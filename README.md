# ComparisonResearch
Embarcadero Technologies is actively researching, testing, and comparing software development frameworks in competing or nearby marketspaces.  Throughout this project, we will test specific aspects of software development by developing benchmark applications in each framework and sharing our analysis in white papers.  

# White Papers
1. ***Discovering the BEST Developer Framework through Benchmarking*** - Uses a Windows 10 Calculator clone as the benchmark application to explore framework GUI flexibility and developer productivity.  See [Comparison Research/calculator](https://github.com/Embarcadero/ComparisonResearch/tree/main/calculator) for the paper and source material.  

# References
This project builds on the work of academics from around the world.  Whenever the resources cited in these white papers are available freely, they will be uploaded to [ComparisonResearch/Academic Resources](https://github.com/Embarcadero/ComparisonResearch/tree/main/Academic%20Resources) for you to examine.

# Community Involvement
This project is meant to start a conversation! Read the papers, write a blog post in response or a better version of our benchmark applications, and submit a GitHub pull request so we can add it to the repository. Found an error? Submit an issue so we can improve this project and collect best-practices and techniques for each framework.
