# Electron

This calculator is written using Node.JS and XAML and uses the Electron framework to reach desktop platforms.

Electron is an open-source (MIT License), Chromium-based framework that utilizes web technologies to build desktop applications on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It was originally developed by and is still maintained by GitHub (a subsidiary of Microsoft). Electron combines the Chromium-based rendering engine with the Node.js runtime. As such, the user interface for an Electron application is available via HTML5 and CSS. Generally, Electron works with most Javascript frameworks such as Angular, Vue.js, and React. The HTML5, CSS, and Javascript-based technologies found in Chromium provide for a rich ecosystem of user customization familiar to any web developer.
