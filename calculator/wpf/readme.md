# Windows Presentation Foundation with .NET Framework

This calculator is written in XAML and C# using WPF tied to .NET Framework.  

Microsoft’s Windows Presentation Foundation is a GUI development system that uses DirectX and the eXtensible Application Markup Language (XAML) to separate user interfaces from business logic. Microsoft’s Visual Studio is the native IDE for WPF and provides a What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get view of WPF applications along with drag-and-drop components for visual design. .NET Framework libraries included with every Windows installation provide a plethora of user interface controls and WPF supports complete style creation and modification. WPF will compile to a native Windows binary for installation on the Windows desktop or to an XAML Browser Application for cross-platform use in web browser sandboxes.
