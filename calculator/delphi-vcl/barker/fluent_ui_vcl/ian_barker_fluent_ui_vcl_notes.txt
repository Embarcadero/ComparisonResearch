**** BEFORE YOU OPEN/COMPILE THE PROJECT  ****
**********************************************

This project uses the AlmediaDev Style controls.

You can get a fully-working trial copy here: http://www.almdev.com/prods/stylecontrols/stylecontrols.html

You MUST have either an up-to-date licensed copy or a trial copy installed
in the RAD Studio / Delphi IDE or the project will not work!

The project also uses "DelphiDarkMode" written by Ian Barker.
You can get the latest version of this open source code here: https://github.com/checkdigits/delphidarkmode

You also need to install the free "Tablet Dark" VCL style.  You can install it via GetIt or from the EMB website
if you don't have it although it should be already there for recent versions of RAD Studio.

For purists the "Carbon" VCL style is the closest to the actual Windows calculator style but it's not
optimized for hi DPI and is not listed on GetIt.

If you do not want to use "Tablet Dark" for the dark mode style then edit the following:

procedure TVCLCalculatorForm.MatchWindowsTheme;

and change SetAppropriateThemeMode('Tablet Dark', 'Windows10'); and change 'Tablet Dark' to whatever dark theme you prefer.
