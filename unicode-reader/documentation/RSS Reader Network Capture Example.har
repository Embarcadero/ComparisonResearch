depends on the specific datasets and on the choice of model, although it often means that using more data can result in better performance and that discoveries made using smaller datasets to estimate model performance often scale to using larger datasets.</p>\n<p>The problem is the relationship is unknown for a given dataset and model, and may not exist for some datasets and models. Additionally, if such a relationship does exist, there may be a point or points of diminishing returns where adding more data may not improve model performance or where datasets are too small to effectively capture the capability of a model at a larger scale.</p>\n<p>These issues can be addressed by performing a <strong>sensitivity analysis</strong> to quantify the relationship between dataset size and model performance.

The relationship often involves an improvement in performance to a point and a general reduction in the expected variance of the model as the dataset size is increased.</p>\n<p>Knowing this relationship for your model and dataset can be helpful for a number of reasons, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Evaluate more models.</li>\n<li>Find a better model.</li>\n<li>Decide to gather more data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can evaluate a large number of models and model configurations quickly on a smaller sample of the dataset with confidence that the performance will likely generalize in a specific way to a larger training dataset.</p>\n<p>This may allow evaluating many more models and configurations than you may otherwise be able to given the time available, and in turn, perhaps discover a better overall performing model.</p>\n<p>You may also be able to generalize and estimate the expected performance of model performance to much larger datasets and estimate whether it is worth the effort or expense of gathering more training data.</p>\n<p>Now that we are familiar with the idea of performing a sensitivity analysis of model performance to dataset size, let&#8217;s look at a worked example.</p>\n<h2>Synthetic Prediction Task and Baseline Model</h2>\n<p>Before we dive into a sensitivity analysis, let&#8217;s select a dataset and baseline model for the investigation.</p>\n<p>We will use a synthetic binary (two-class) classification dataset in this tutorial. This is ideal as it allows us to scale the number of generated samples for the same problem as needed.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_classification.html\">make_classification() scikit-learn function</a> can be used to create a synthetic classification dataset. In this case, we will use 20 input features (columns) and generate 1,000 samples (rows). The seed for the pseudo-random number generator is fixed to ensure the same base &#8220;problem&#8221; is used each time samples are generated.</p>\n<p>The example below generates the synthetic classification dataset and summarizes the shape of the generated data.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\"># test classification dataset\r\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_classification\r\n# define dataset\r\nX, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_informative=15, n_redundant=5, random_state=1)\r\n# summarize the dataset\r\nprint(X.shape, y.shape)</pre><p>Running the example generates the data and reports the size of the input and output components, confirming the expected shape.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">(1000, 20) (1000,)</pre><p>Next, we can evaluate a predictive model on this dataset.</p>\n<p>We will use a decision tree (<a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html\">DecisionTreeClassifier</a>) as the predictive model. It was chosen because it is a nonlinear algorithm and has a high variance, which means that we would expect performance to improve with increases in the size of the training dataset.</p>\n<p>We will use a best practice of <a href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/repeated-k-fold-cross-validation-with-python/\">repeated stratified k-fold cross-validation</a> to evaluate the model on the dataset, with 3 repeats and 10 folds.</p>\n<p>The complete example of evaluating the decision tree model on the synthetic classification dataset is listed below.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\"># evaluate a decision tree model on the synthetic classification dataset\r\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_classification\r\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\r\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import RepeatedStratifiedKFold\r\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\r\n# load dataset\r\nX, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_informative=15, n_redundant=5, random_state=1)\r\n# define model evaluation procedure\r\ncv = RepeatedStratifiedKFold(n_splits=10, n_repeats=3, random_state=1)\r\n# define model\r\nmodel = DecisionTreeClassifier()\r\n# evaluate model\r\nscores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, scoring='accuracy', cv=cv, n_jobs=-1)\r\n# report performance\r\nprint('Mean Accuracy: %.3f (%.3f)' % (scores.mean(), scores.std()))</pre><p>Running the example creates the dataset then estimates the performance of the model on the problem using the chosen test harness.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Your <a href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/different-results-each-time-in-machine-learning/\">results may vary</a> given the stochastic nature of the algorithm or evaluation procedure, or differences in numerical precision. Consider running the example a few times and compare the average outcome.</p>\r\n\n<p>In this case, we can see that the mean classification accuracy is about 82.7%.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">Mean Accuracy: 0.827 (0.042)</pre><p>Next, let&#8217;s look at how we might perform a sensitivity analysis of dataset size on model performance.</p>\n<h2>Sensitivity Analysis of Dataset Size</h2>\n<p>The previous section showed how to evaluate a chosen model on the available dataset.</p>\n<p>It raises questions, such as:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Will the model perform better on more data?</p></blockquote>\n<p>More generally, we may have sophisticated questions such as:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Does the estimated performance hold on smaller or larger samples from the problem domain?</p></blockquote>\n<p>These are hard questions to answer, but we can approach them by using a sensitivity analysis. Specifically, we can use a sensitivity analysis to learn:</p>\n<blockquote><p>How sensitive is model performance to dataset size?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Or more generally:</p>\n<blockquote><p>What is the relationship of dataset size to model performance?</p></blockquote>\n<p>There are many ways to perform a sensitivity analysis, but perhaps the simplest approach is to define a test harness to evaluate model performance and then evaluate the same model on the same problem with differently sized datasets.</p>\n<p>This will allow the train and test portions of the dataset to increase with the size of the overall dataset.</p>\n<p>To make the code easier to read, we will split it up into functions.</p>\n<p>First, we can define a function that will prepare (or load) the dataset of a given size. The number of rows in the dataset is specified by an argument to the function.</p>\n<p>If you are using this code as a template, this function can be changed to load your dataset from file and select a random sample of a given size.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\"># load dataset\r\ndef load_dataset(n_samples):\r\n\t# define the dataset\r\n\tX, y = make_classification(n_samples=int(n_samples), n_features=20, n_informative=15, n_redundant=5, random_state=1)\r\n\treturn X, y</pre><p>Next, we need a function to evaluate a model on a loaded dataset.</p>\n<p>We will define a function that takes a dataset and returns a summary of the performance of the model evaluated using the test harness on the dataset.</p>\n<p>This function is listed below, taking the input and output elements of a dataset and returning the mean and standard deviation of the decision tree model on the dataset.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\"># evaluate a model\r\ndef evaluate_model(X, y):\r\n\t# define model evaluation procedure\r\n\tcv = RepeatedStratifiedKFold(n_splits=10, n_repeats=3, random_state=1)\r\n\t# define model\r\n\tmodel = DecisionTreeClassifier()\r\n\t# evaluate model\r\n\tscores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, scoring='accuracy', cv=cv, n_jobs=-1)\r\n\t# return summary stats\r\n\treturn [scores.mean(), scores.std()]</pre><p>Next, we can define a range of different dataset sizes to evaluate.</p>\n<p>The sizes should be chosen proportional to the amount of data you have available and the amount of running time you are willing to expend.</p>\n<p>In this case, we will keep the sizes modest to limit running time, from 50 to one million rows on a rough log10 scale.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">...\r\n# define number of samples to consider\r\nsizes = [50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, 50000, 100000, 500000, 1000000]</pre><p>Next, we can enumerate each dataset size, create the dataset, evaluate a model on the dataset, and store the results for later analysis.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">...\r\n# evaluate each number of samples\r\nmeans, stds = list(), list()\r\nfor n_samples in sizes:\r\n\t# get a dataset\r\n\tX, y = load_dataset(n_samples)\r\n\t# evaluate a model on this dataset size\r\n\tmean, std = evaluate_model(X, y)\r\n\t# store\r\n\tmeans.append(mean)\r\n\tstds.append(std)</pre><p>Next, we can summarize the relationship between the dataset size and model performance.</p>\n<p>In this case, we will simply plot the result with error bars so we can spot any trends visually.</p>\n<p>We will use the standard deviation as a measure of uncertainty on the estimated model performance. This can be achieved by multiplying the value by 2 to cover approximately 95% of the expected performance if the performance follows a normal distribution.</p>\n<p>This can be shown on the plot as an error bar around the mean expected performance for a dataset size.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">...\r\n# define error bar as 2 standard deviations from the mean or 95%\r\nerr = [min(1, s * 2) for s in stds]\r\n# plot dataset size vs mean performance with error bars\r\npyplot.errorbar(sizes, means, yerr=err, fmt='-o')</pre><p>To make the plot more readable, we can change the scale of the x-axis to log, given that our dataset sizes are on a rough log10 scale.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">...\r\n# change the scale of the x-axis to log\r\nax = pyplot.gca()\r\nax.set_xscale(\"log\", nonpositive='clip')\r\n# show the plot\r\npyplot.show()</pre><p>And that&#8217;s it.</p>\n<p>We would generally expect mean model performance to increase with dataset size.

The uncertainty comes from the errors in the model itself and noise in the input data. The model is an approximation of the relationship between the input variables and the output variables.</p>\n<p>A prediction interval is a quantification of the uncertainty on a prediction.</p>\n<p>It provides a probabilistic upper and lower bounds on the estimate of an outcome variable.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A prediction interval for a single future observation is an interval that will, with a specified degree of confidence, contain a future randomly selected observation from a distribution.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; Page 27, <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2G8w3IL\">Statistical Intervals: A Guide for Practitioners and Researchers</a>, 2017.</p>\n<p>Prediction intervals are most commonly used when making predictions or forecasts with a regression model, where a quantity is being predicted.</p>\n<p>The prediction interval surrounds the prediction made by the model and hopefully covers the range of the true outcome.</p>\n<p>For more on prediction intervals in general, see the tutorial:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/prediction-intervals-for-machine-learning/\">Prediction Intervals for Machine Learning</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now that we are familiar with what a prediction interval is, we can consider how we might calculate an interval for a neural network. Let&#8217;s start by defining a regression problem and a neural network model to address it.</p>\n<h2>Neural Network for Regression</h2>\n<p>In this section, we will define a regression predictive modeling problem and a neural network model to address it.</p>\n<p>First, let&#8217;s introduce a standard regression dataset. We will use the housing dataset.</p>\n<p>The housing dataset is a standard machine learning dataset comprising 506 rows of data with 13 numerical input variables and a numerical target variable.</p>\n<p>Using a test harness of repeated stratified 10-fold cross-validation with three repeats, a naive model can achieve a mean absolute error (MAE) of about 6.6.

There is no standard technique.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to calculate an effective prediction interval for neural network models. I recommend some of the papers listed in the &#8220;<em>further reading</em>&#8221; section to learn more.</p>\n<p>In this tutorial, we will use a very simple approach that has plenty of room for extension. I refer to it as &#8220;<em>quick and dirty</em>&#8221; because it is fast and easy to calculate, but is limited.</p>\n<p>It involves fitting multiple final models (e.g. 10 to 30). The distribution of the point predictions from ensemble members is then used to calculate both a point prediction and a prediction interval.</p>\n<p>For example, a point prediction can be taken as the mean of the point predictions from ensemble members, and a 95% prediction interval can be taken as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1.96\">1.96 standard deviations</a> from the mean.</p>\n<p>This is a simple Gaussian prediction interval, although alternatives could be used, such as the min and max of the point predictions. Alternatively, the bootstrap method could be used to train each ensemble member on a different bootstrap sample and the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the point predictions can be used as prediction intervals.</p>\n<p>For more on the bootstrap method, see the tutorial:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-the-bootstrap-method/\">A Gentle Introduction to the Bootstrap Method</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These extensions are left as exercises; we will stick with the simple Gaussian prediction interval.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s assume that the training dataset, defined in the previous section, is the entire dataset and we are training a final model or models on this entire dataset. We can then make predictions with prediction intervals on the test set and evaluate how effective the interval might be in the future.</p>\n<p>We can simplify the code by dividing the elements developed in the previous section into functions.</p>\n<p>First, let&#8217;s define a function for loading and preparing a regression dataset defined by a URL.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\"># load and prepare the dataset\r\ndef load_dataset(url):\r\n\tdataframe = read_csv(url, header=None)\r\n\tvalues = dataframe.values\r\n\t# split into input and output values\r\n\tX, y = values[:, :-1], values[:,-1]\r\n\t# split into train and test sets\r\n\tX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, train_size=0.67, random_state=1)\r\n\t# scale input data\r\n\tscaler = MinMaxScaler()\r\n\tscaler.fit(X_train)\r\n\tX_train = scaler.transform(X_train)\r\n\tX_test = scaler.transform(X_test)\r\n\treturn X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test</pre><p>Next, we can define a function that will define and train an MLP model given the training dataset, then return the fit model ready for making predictions.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\"># define and fit the model\r\ndef fit_model(X_train, y_train):\r\n\t# define neural network model\r\n\tfeatures = X_train.shape[1]\r\n\tmodel = Sequential()\r\n\tmodel.add(Dense(20, kernel_initializer='he_normal', activation='relu', input_dim=features))\r\n\tmodel.add(Dense(5, kernel_initializer='he_normal', activation='relu'))\r\n\tmodel.add(Dense(1))\r\n\t# compile the model and specify loss and optimizer\r\n\topt = Adam(learning_rate=0.01, beta_1=0.85, beta_2=0.999)\r\n\tmodel.compile(optimizer=opt, loss='mse')\r\n\t# fit the model on the training dataset\r\n\tmodel.fit(X_train, y_train, verbose=0, epochs=300, batch_size=16)\r\n\treturn model</pre><p>We require multiple models to make point predictions that will define a distribution of point predictions from which we can estimate the interval.</p>\n<p>As such, we will need to fit multiple models on the training dataset.

A slow cooling brings the material to an ordered, crystalline state.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; Page 128, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/34Nb7nv\">Algorithms for Optimization</a>, 2019.</p>\n<p>The simulated annealing optimization algorithm can be thought of as a modified version of stochastic hill climbing.</p>\n<p>Stochastic hill climbing maintains a single candidate solution and takes steps of a random but constrained size from the candidate in the search space. If the new point is better than the current point, then the current point is replaced with the new point. This process continues for a fixed number of iterations.</p>\n<p>Simulated annealing executes the search in the same way. The main difference is that new points that are not as good as the current point (worse points) are accepted sometimes.</p>\n<p>A worse point is accepted probabilistically where the likelihood of accepting a solution worse than the current solution is a function of the temperature of the search and how much worse the solution is than the current solution.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The algorithm varies from Hill-Climbing in its decision of when to replace S, the original candidate solution, with R, its newly tweaked child. Specifically: if R is better than S, we&#8217;ll always replace S with R as usual. But if R is worse than S, we may still replace S with R with a certain probability</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; Page 23, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3iQkCaw\">Essentials of Metaheuristics</a>, 2011.</p>\n<p>The initial temperature for the search is provided as a hyperparameter and decreases with the progress of the search. A number of different schemes (annealing schedules) may be used to decrease the temperature during the search from the initial value to a very low value, although it is common to calculate temperature as a function of the iteration number.</p>\n<p>A popular example for calculating temperature is the so-called &#8220;<em>fast simulated annealing</em>,&#8221; calculated as follows</p>\n<ul>\n<li>temperature = initial_temperature / (iteration_number + 1)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We add one to the iteration number in the case that iteration numbers start at zero, to avoid a divide by zero error.</p>\n<p>The acceptance of worse solutions uses the temperature as well as the difference between the objective function evaluation of the worse solution and the current solution. A value is calculated between 0 and 1 using this information, indicating the likelihood of accepting the worse solution. This distribution is then sampled using a random number, which, if less than the value, means the worse solution is accepted.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is this acceptance probability, known as the Metropolis criterion, that allows the algorithm to escape from local minima when the temperature is high.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; Page 128, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/34Nb7nv\">Algorithms for Optimization</a>, 2019.</p>\n<p>This is called the metropolis acceptance criterion and for minimization is calculated as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>criterion = exp( -(objective(new) &#8211; objective(current)) / temperature)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where <em>exp()</em> is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)\">e</a> (the mathematical constant) raised to a power of the provided argument, and <em>objective(new)</em>, and <em>objective(current)</em> are the objective function evaluation of the new (worse) and current candidate solutions.</p>\n<p>The effect is that poor solutions have more chances of being accepted early in the search and less likely of being accepted later in the search. The intent is that the high temperature at the beginning of the search will help the search locate the basin for the global optima and the low temperature later in the search will help the algorithm hone in on the global optima.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The temperature starts high, allowing the process to freely move about the search space, with the hope that in this phase the process will find a good region with the best local minimum. The temperature is then slowly brought down, reducing the stochasticity and forcing the search to converge to a minimum</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; Page 128, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/34Nb7nv\">Algorithms for Optimization</a>, 2019.</p>\n<p>Now that we are familiar with the simulated annealing algorithm, let&#8217;s look at how to implement it from scratch.</p>\n<h2>Implement Simulated Annealing</h2>\n<p>In this section, we will explore how we might implement the simulated annealing optimization algorithm from scratch.</p>\n<p>First, we must define our objective function and the bounds on each input variable to the objective function. The objective function is just a Python function we will name <em>objective()</em>. The bounds will be a 2D array with one dimension for each input variable that defines the minimum and maximum for the variable.</p>\n<p>For example, a one-dimensional objective function and bounds would be defined as follows:</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\"># objective function\r\ndef objective(x):\r\n\treturn 0\r\n\r\n# define range for input\r\nbounds = asarray([[-5.0, 5.0]])</pre><p>Next, we can generate our initial point as a random point within the bounds of the problem, then evaluate it using the objective function.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">...\r\n# generate an initial point\r\nbest = bounds[:, 0] + rand(len(bounds)) * (bounds[:, 1] - bounds[:, 0])\r\n# evaluate the initial point\r\nbest_eval = objective(best)</pre><p>We need to maintain the &#8220;<em>current</em>&#8221; solution that is the focus of the search and that may be replaced with better solutions.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">...\r\n# current working solution\r\ncurr, curr_eval = best, best_eval</pre><p>Now we can loop over a predefined number of iterations of the algorithm defined as &#8220;<em>n_iterations</em>&#8220;, such as 100 or 1,000.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">...\r\n# run the algorithm\r\nfor i in range(n_iterations):\r\n\t...</pre><p>The first step of the algorithm iteration is to generate a new candidate solution from the current working solution, e.g. take a step.</p>\n<p>This requires a predefined &#8220;<em>step_size</em>&#8221; parameter, which is relative to the bounds of the search space. We will take a random step with a Gaussian distribution where the mean is our current point and the standard deviation is defined by the &#8220;<em>step_size</em>&#8220;. That means that about 99 percent of the steps taken will be within <em>3 * step_size</em> of the current point.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">...\r\n# take a step\r\ncandidate = solution + randn(len(bounds)) * step_size</pre><p>We don&#8217;t have to take steps in this way.

For example:</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">...\r\n# take a step\r\ncandidate = solution + rand(len(bounds)) * step_size</pre><p>Next, we need to evaluate it.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">...\r\n# evaluate candidate point\r\ncandidte_eval = objective(candidate)</pre><p>We then need to check if the evaluation of this new point is as good as or better than the current best point, and if it is, replace our current best point with this new point.</p>\n<p>This is separate from the current working solution that is the focus of the search.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">...\r\n# check for new best solution\r\nif candidate_eval &lt;

Nevertheless, in this table, we can calculate the average performance of any algorithm from all the values in its column and it will be identical to the average performance of any other algorithm column.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If one algorithm performs better than another algorithm on one class of problems, then it will perform worse on another class of problems</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; Page 6, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/34Nb7nv\">Algorithms for Optimization</a>, 2019.</p>\n<p>Now that we are familiar with the no free lunch theorem in general, let&#8217;s look at the specific implications for optimization.</p>\n<h2>Implications for Optimization</h2>\n<p>So-called black-box optimization algorithms are general optimization algorithms that can be applied to many different optimization problems and assume very little about the objective function.</p>\n<p>Examples of black-box algorithms include the genetic algorithm, simulated annealing, and particle swarm optimization.</p>\n<p>The no free lunch theorem was proposed in an environment of the late 1990s where claims of one black-box optimization algorithm being better than another optimization algorithm were being made routinely. The theorem pushes back on this, indicating that there is no best optimization algorithm, that it is provably impossible.</p>\n<p>The theorem does state that no optimization algorithm is any better than any other optimization algorithm, on average.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230; known as the “no free lunch” theorem, sets a limit on how good a learner can be. The limit is pretty low: no learner can be better than random guessing!</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; Page 63, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3lKKGFX\">The Master Algorithm</a>, 2018.</p>\n<p>The catch is that the application of algorithms does not assume anything about the problem. In fact, algorithms are applied to objective functions with no prior knowledge, even such as whether the objective function is minimizing or maximizing. And this is a hard constraint of the theorem.</p>\n<p>We often have &#8220;<em>some</em>&#8221; knowledge about the objective function being optimized. In fact, if in practice we truly knew nothing about the objective function, we could not choose an optimization algorithm.</p>\n<blockquote><p>As elaborated by the no free lunch theorems of Wolpert and Macready, there is no reason to prefer one algorithm over another unless we make assumptions about the probability distribution over the space of possible objective functions.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; Page 6, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/34Nb7nv\">Algorithms for Optimization</a>, 2019.</p>\n<p>The beginner practitioner in the field of optimization is counseled to learn and use as much about the problem as possible in the optimization algorithm.</p>\n<p>The more we know and harness in the algorithms about the problem, the better tailored the technique is to the problem and the more likely the algorithm is expected to perform well on the problem. The no free lunch theorem supports this advice.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We don’t care about all possible worlds, only the one we live in. If we know something about the world and incorporate it into our learner, it now has an advantage over random guessing.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; Page 63, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3lKKGFX\">The Master Algorithm</a>, 2018.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the performance is averaged over all possible objective functions and all possible optimization algorithms. Whereas in practice, we are interested in a small subset of objective functions that may have a specific structure or form and algorithms tailored to those functions.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230; we cannot emphasize enough that no claims whatsoever are being made in this paper concerning how well various search algorithms work in practice The focus of this paper is on what can be said a priori without any assumptions and from mathematical principles alone concerning the utility of a search algorithm.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/585893\">No Free Lunch Theorems For Optimization</a>, 1997.</p>\n<p>These implications lead some practitioners to note the limited practical value of the theorem.</p>\n<blockquote><p>This is of considerable theoretical interest but, I think, of limited practical value, because the space of all possible problems likely includes many extremely unusual and pathological problems which are rarely if ever seen in practice.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; Page 203, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3iQkCaw\">Essentials of Metaheuristics</a>, 2011.</p>\n<p>Now that we have reviewed the implications of the no free lunch theorem for optimization, let&#8217;s review the implications for machine learning.</p>\n<h2>Implications for Machine Learning</h2>\n<p>Learning can be described or framed as an optimization problem, and most machine learning algorithms solve an optimization problem at their core.</p>\n<p>The no free lunch theorem for optimization and search is applied to machine learning, specifically supervised learning, which underlies classification and regression predictive modeling tasks.</p>\n<p>This means that all machine learning algorithms are equally effective across all possible prediction problems, e.g. random forest is as good as random predictions.</p>\n<blockquote><p>So all learning algorithms are the same in that: (1) by several definitions of &#8220;average&#8221;, all algorithms have the same average off-training-set misclassification risk, (2) therefore no learning algorithm can have lower risk than another one for all f &#8230;</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4471-0123-9_3\">The Supervised Learning No-Free-Lunch Theorems</a>, 2002.</p>\n<p>This also has implications for the way in which algorithms are evaluated or chosen, such as choosing a learning algorithm via a k-fold cross-validation test harness or not.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230; an algorithm that uses cross validation to choose amongst a prefixed set of learning algorithms does no better on average than one that does not.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4471-0123-9_3\">The Supervised Learning No-Free-Lunch Theorems</a>, 2002.</p>\n<p>It also has implications for common heuristics for what constitutes a &#8220;<em>good</em>&#8221; machine learning model, such as avoiding overfitting or choosing the simplest possible model that performs well.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Another set of examples is provided by all the heuristics that people have come up with for supervised learning avoid overfitting prefer simpler to more complex models etc. [no free lunch] says that all such heuristics fail as often as they succeed.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4471-0123-9_3\">The Supervised Learning No-Free-Lunch Theorems</a>, 2002.</p>\n<p>Given that there is no best single machine learning algorithm across all possible prediction problems, it motivates the need to continue to develop new learning algorithms and to better understand algorithms that have already been developed.</p>\n<blockquote><p>As a consequence of the no free lunch theorem, we need to develop many different types of models, to cover the wide variety of data that occurs in the real world. And for each model, there may be many different algorithms we can use to train the model, which make different speed-accuracy-complexity tradeoffs.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; Pages 24-25, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3nJJe8s\">Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective</a>, 2012.</p>\n<p>It also supports the argument of testing a suite of different machine learning algorithms for a given predictive modeling problem.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;<em>No Free Lunch</em>&#8221; Theorem argues that, without having substantive information about the modeling problem, there is no single model that will always do better than any other model. Because of this, a strong case can be made to try a wide variety of techniques, then determine which model to focus on.</p>\n<p>&#8212; Pages 25-26, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ly7nwK\">Applied Predictive Modeling</a>, 2013.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, as with optimization, the implications of the theorem are based on the choice of learning algorithms having zero knowledge of the problem that is being solved.</p>\n<p>In practice, this is not the case, and a beginner machine learning practitioner is encouraged to review the available data in order to learn something about the problem that can be incorporated into the learning algorithm.</p>\n<p>We may even want to take this one step further and say that learning is not possible without some prior knowledge and that data alone is not enough.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In the meantime, the practical consequence of the “no free lunch” theorem is that there’s no such thing as learning without knowledge. Data alone is not enough.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; Page 64, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3lKKGFX\">The Master Algorithm</a>, 2018.</p>\n<h2>Further Reading</h2>\n<p>This section provides more

are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What Is Stochastic Optimization?</li>\n<li>Stochastic Optimization Algorithms</li>\n<li>Practical Considerations for Stochastic Optimization</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What Is Stochastic Optimization?</h2>\n<p>Optimization refers to optimization algorithms that seek the inputs to a function that result in the minimum or maximum of an objective function.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/stochastic-in-machine-learning/\">Stochastic</a> optimization or stochastic search refers to an optimization task that involves randomness in some way, such as either from the objective function or in the optimization algorithm.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Stochastic search and optimization pertains to problems where there is randomness noise in the measurements provided to the algorithm and/or there is injected (Monte Carlo) randomness in the algorithm itself.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; Page xiii, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/34JYN7m\">Introduction to Stochastic Search and Optimization</a>, 2003.</p>\n<p>Randomness in the objective function means that the evaluation of candidate solutions involves some uncertainty or noise and algorithms must be chosen that can make progress in the search in the presence of this noise.</p>\n<p>Randomness in the algorithm is used as a strategy, e.g. stochastic or probabilistic decisions. It is used as an alternative to deterministic decisions in an effort to improve the likelihood of locating the global optima or a better local optima.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Standard stochastic optimization methods are brittle, sensitive to stepsize choice and other algorithmic parameters, and they exhibit instability outside of well-behaved families of objectives.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/116/46/22924\">The Importance Of Better Models In Stochastic Optimization</a>, 2019.</p>\n<p>It is more common to refer to an algorithm that uses randomness than an objective function that contains noisy evaluations when discussing stochastic optimization. This is because randomness in the objective function can be addressed by using randomness in the optimization algorithm. As such, stochastic optimization may be referred to as &#8220;<em>robust optimization</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A deterministic algorithm may be misled (e.g. &#8220;<em>deceived</em>&#8221; or &#8220;<em>confused</em>&#8220;) by the noisy evaluation of candidate solutions or noisy function gradients, causing the algorithm to bounce around or get stuck (e.g. fail to converge).</p>\n<blockquote><p>Methods for stochastic optimization provide a means of coping with inherent system noise and coping with models or systems that are highly nonlinear, high dimensional, or otherwise inappropriate for classical deterministic methods of optimization.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-21551-3_7\">Stochastic Optimization</a>, 2011.</p>\n<p>Using randomness in an optimization algorithm allows the search procedure to perform well on challenging optimization problems that may have a nonlinear response surface. This is achieved by the algorithm taking locally suboptimal steps or moves in the search space that allow it to escape local optima.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Randomness can help escape local optima and increase the chances of finding a global optimum.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; Page 8, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2FkbblQ\">Algorithms for Optimization</a>, 2019.</p>\n<p>The randomness used in a stochastic optimization algorithm does not have to be true randomness; instead, pseudorandom is sufficient. A <a href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/introduction-to-random-number-generators-for-machine-learning/\">pseudorandom number generator</a> is almost universally used in stochastic optimization.</p>\n<p>Use of randomness in a stochastic optimization algorithm does not mean that the algorithm is random. Instead, it means that some decisions made during the search procedure involve some portion of randomness. For example, we can conceptualize this as the move from the current to the next point in the search space made by the algorithm may be made according to a probability distribution relative to the optimal move.</p>\n<p>Now that we have an idea of what stochastic optimization is, let&#8217;s look at some examples of stochastic optimization algorithms.</p>\n<h2>Stochastic Optimization Algorithms</h2>\n<p>The use of randomness in the algorithms often means that the techniques are referred to as &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_(computer_science)\">heuristic search</a>&#8221; as they use a rough rule-of-thumb procedure that may or may not work to find the optima instead of a precise procedure.</p>\n<p>Many stochastic algorithms are inspired by a biological or natural process and may be referred to as &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaheuristic\">metaheuristics</a>&#8221; as a higher-order procedure providing the conditions for a specific search of the objective function. They are also referred to as &#8220;<em>black box</em>&#8221; optimization algorithms.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Metaheuristics is a rather unfortunate term often used to describe a major subfield, indeed the primary subfield, of stochastic optimization.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; Page 7, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3lHryZr\">Essentials of Metaheuristics</a>, 2011.</p>\n<p>There are many stochastic optimization algorithms.</p>\n<p>Some examples of stochastic optimization algorithms include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Iterated Local Search</li>\n<li>Stochastic Hill Climbing</li>\n<li>Stochastic Gradient Descent</li>\n<li>Tabu Search</li>\n<li>Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some examples of stochastic optimization algorithms that are inspired by biological or physical processes include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Simulated Annealing</li>\n<li>Evolution Strategies</li>\n<li>Genetic Algorithm</li>\n<li>Differential Evolution</li>\n<li>Particle Swarm Optimization</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now that we are familiar with some examples of stochastic optimization algorithms, let&#8217;s look at some practical considerations when using them.</p>\n<h2>Practical Considerations for Stochastic Optimization</h2>\n<p>There are important considerations when using stochastic optimization algorithms.</p>\n<p>The stochastic nature of the procedure means that any single run of an algorithm will be different, given a different source of randomness used by the algorithm and, in turn, different starting points for the search and decisions made during the search.</p>\n<p>The pseudorandom number generator used as the source of randomness can be seeded to ensure the same sequence of random numbers is provided each run of the algorithm. This is good for small demonstrations and tutorials, although it is fragile as it is working against the inherent randomness of the algorithm.</p>\n<p>Instead, a given algorithm can be executed many times to control for the randomness of the procedure.</p>\n<p>This idea of multiple runs of the algorithm can be used in two key situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Comparing Algorithms</li>\n<li>Evaluating Final Result</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Algorithms may be compared based on the relative quality of the result found, the number of function evaluations performed, or some combination or derivation of these considerations. The result of any one run will depend upon the randomness used by the algorithm and alone cannot meaningfully represent the capability of the algorithm. Instead, a strategy of repeated evaluation should be used.</p>\n<p>Any comparison between stochastic optimization algorithms will require the repeated evaluation of each algorithm with a different source of randomness and the summarization of the probability distribution of best results found, such as the mean and standard deviation of objective values. The mean result from each algorithm can then be compared.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In cases where multiple local minima are likely to exist, it can be beneficial to incorporate random restarts after our terminiation conditions are met where we restart our local descent method from randomly selected initial points.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; Page 66, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2FkbblQ\">Algorithms for Optimization</a>, 2019.</p>\n<p>Similarly, any single run of a chosen optimization algorithm alone does not meaningfully represent the global optima of the objective function. Instead, a strategy of repeated evaluation should be used to develop a distribution of optimal solutions.</p>\n<p>The maximum or minimum of the distribution can be taken as the final solution, and the distribution itself will provide a point of reference and confidence that the solution found is &#8220;<em>relatively good</em>&#8221; or &#8220;<em>good enough</em>&#8221; given the resources expended.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Multi-Restart</strong>: An approach for improving the likelihood of locating the global optima via the repeated application of a stochastic optimization algorithm to an optimization problem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The repeated application of a stochastic optimization algorithm on an objective function is sometimes referred to as a multi-restart strategy and may be built in to the optimization algorithm itself or prescribed more generally as a procedure around the chosen stochastic optimization algorithm.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Each time you do a random restart, the hill-climber then winds up in some (possibly new) local optimum.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; Page 26, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3lHryZr\">Essentials of Metaheuristics</a>, 2011.</p>\n<h2>Further

Because the models are linear and well understood, efficient optimization algorithms can be used.</p>\n<p>In the case of linear regression, the coefficients can be found by least squares optimization, which can be solved using <a href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/solve-linear-regression-using-linear-algebra/\">linear algebra</a>. In the case of logistic regression, a local search optimization algorithm is commonly used.</p>\n<p>It is possible to use any arbitrary optimization algorithm to train linear and logistic regression models.</p>\n<p>That is, we can define a regression model and use a given optimization algorithm to find a set of coefficients for the model that result in a minimum of prediction error or a maximum of classification accuracy.</p>\n<p>Using alternate optimization algorithms is expected to be less efficient on average than using the recommended optimization. Nevertheless, it may be more efficient in some specific cases, such as if the input data does not meet the expectations of the model like a Gaussian distribution and is uncorrelated with outer inputs.</p>\n<p>It can also be an interesting exercise to demonstrate the central nature of optimization in training machine learning algorithms, and specifically regression models.</p>\n<p>Next, let&#8217;s explore how to train a linear regression model using stochastic hill climbing.</p>\n<h2>Optimize a Linear Regression Model</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-linear-regression-stochastic-gradient-descent-scratch-python/\">linear regression</a> model might be the simplest predictive model that learns from data.</p>\n<p>The model has one coefficient for each input and the predicted output is simply the weights of some inputs and coefficients.</p>\n<p>In this section, we will optimize the coefficients of a linear regression model.</p>\n<p>First, let&#8217;s define a synthetic regression problem that we can use as the focus of optimizing the model.</p>\n<p>We can use the <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_regression.html\">make_regression() function</a> to define a regression problem with 1,000 rows and 10 input variables.</p>\n<p>The example below creates the dataset and summarizes the shape of the data.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\"># define a regression dataset\r\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_regression\r\n# define dataset\r\nX, y = make_regression(n_samples=1000, n_features=10, n_informative=2, noise=0.2, random_state=1)\r\n# summarize the shape of the dataset\r\nprint(X.shape, y.shape)</pre><p>Running the example prints the shape of the created dataset, confirming our expectations.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">(1000, 10) (1000,)</pre><p>Next, we need to define a linear regression model.</p>\n<p>Before we optimize the model coefficients, we must develop the model and our confidence in how it works.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start by developing a function that calculates the activation of the model for a given input row of data from the dataset.</p>\n<p>This function will take the row of data and the coefficients for the model and calculate the weighted sum of the input with the addition of an extra y-intercept (also called the offset or bias) coefficient. The <em>predict_row()</em> function below implements this.</p>\n<p>We are using simple Python lists and imperative programming style instead of <a href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-n-dimensional-arrays-python-numpy/\">NumPy arrays</a> or list compressions intentionally to make the code more readable for Python beginners.

If your function is maximizing, it can be converted to minimizing by adding a negative sign to values returned from your objective function.</p>\n<p>In addition to the above list, the library also provides utility functions used by some of the algorithms, as well as the Rosenbrock test problem.</p>\n<p>For a good overview of the capabilities of the SciPy library for optimization, see:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html\">Optimization and root finding (scipy.optimize) API</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now that we have a high-level idea of the types of optimization techniques supported by the library, let&#8217;s take a closer look at two groups of algorithms we are more likely to use in applied machine learning. They are local search and global search.</p>\n<h2>Local Search With SciPy</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_search_(optimization)\">Local search</a>, or local function optimization, refers to algorithms that seek the input to a function that results in the minimum or maximum output where the function or constrained region being searched is assumed to have a single optima, e.g. unimodal.</p>\n<p>The function that is being optimized may or may not be convex, and may have one or more than one input variable.</p>\n<p>A local search optimization may be applied directly to optimize a function if the function is believed or known to be unimodal; otherwise, the local search algorithm may be applied to fine-tune the result of a global search algorithm.</p>\n<p>The SciPy library provides local search via the <a href=\"https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html\">minimize() function</a>.</p>\n<p>The <em>minimize()</em> function takes as input the name of the objective function that is being minimized and the initial point from which to start the search and returns an <a href=\"https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.OptimizeResult.html\">OptimizeResult</a> that summarizes the success or failure of the search and the details of the solution if found.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">...\r\n# minimize an objective function\r\nresult = minimize(objective, point)</pre><p>Additional information about the objective function can be provided if known, such as the bounds on the input variables, a function for computing the first derivative of the function (gradient or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant\">Jacobian matrix</a>), a function for computing the second derivative of the function (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessian_matrix\">Hessian matrix</a>), and any constraints on the inputs.</p>\n<p>Importantly, the function provides the &#8220;<em>method</em>&#8221; argument that allows the specific optimization used in the local search to be specified.</p>\n<p>A suite of popular local search algorithms are available, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder%E2%80%93Mead_method\">Nelder-Mead Algorithm</a> (method=&#8217;Nelder-Mead&#8217;).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method\">Newton&#8217;s Method</a> (method=&#8217;Newton-CG&#8217;).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powell%27s_method\">Powell&#8217;s Method</a> (method=&#8217;Powell&#8217;).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broyden%E2%80%93Fletcher%E2%80%93Goldfarb%E2%80%93Shanno_algorithm\">BFGS Algorithm and extensions</a> (method=&#8217;BFGS&#8217;).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The example below demonstrates how to solve a two-dimensional convex function using the L-BFGS-B local search algorithm.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\"># l-bfgs-b algorithm local optimization of a convex function\r\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\r\nfrom numpy.random import rand\r\n\r\n# objective function\r\ndef objective(x):\r\n\treturn x[0]**2.0 + x[1]**2.0\r\n\r\n# define range for input\r\nr_min, r_max = -5.0, 5.0\r\n# define the starting point as a random sample from the domain\r\npt = r_min + rand(2) * (r_max - r_min)\r\n# perform the l-bfgs-b algorithm search\r\nresult = minimize(objective, pt, method='L-BFGS-B')\r\n# summarize the result\r\nprint('Status : %s' % result['message'])\r\nprint('Total Evaluations: %d' % result['nfev'])\r\n# evaluate solution\r\nsolution = result['x']\r\nevaluation = objective(solution)\r\nprint('Solution: f(%s) = %.5f' % (solution, evaluation))</pre><p>Running the example performs the optimization and reports the success or failure of the search, the number of function evaluations performed, and the input that resulted in the optima of the function.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">Status : b'CONVERGENCE: NORM_OF_PROJECTED_GRADIENT_&lt;=_PGTOL'\r\nTotal Evaluations: 9\r\nSolution: f([3.38059583e-07 3.70089258e-07]) = 0.00000</pre><p>Now that we are familiar with using a local search algorithm with SciPy, let&#8217;s look at global search.</p>\n<h2>Global Search With SciPy</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_optimization\">Global search</a> or global function optimization refers to algorithms that seek the input to a function that results in the minimum or maximum output where the function or constrained region being searched is assumed to have multiple local optima, e.g. multimodal.</p>\n<p>The function that is being optimized is typically nonlinear, nonconvex, and may have one or more than one input variable.</p>\n<p>Global search algorithms are typically stochastic, meaning that they make use of randomness in the search process and may or may not manage a population of candidate solutions as part of the search.</p>\n<p>The SciPy library provides a number of stochastic global optimization algorithms, each via different functions. They are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basin-hopping\">Basin Hopping Optimization</a> via the <a

href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent\">Gradient descent</a> is an optimization algorithm.</p>\n<p>It is technically referred to as a first-order optimization algorithm as it explicitly makes use of the first-order derivative of the target objective function.</p>\n<blockquote><p>First-order methods rely on gradient information to help direct the search for a minimum &#8230;</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; Page 69, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/39KZSQn\">Algorithms for Optimization</a>, 2019.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative\">first-order derivative</a>, or simply the &#8220;<em>derivative</em>,&#8221; is the rate of change or slope of the target function at a specific point, e.g. for a specific input.</p>\n<p>If the target function takes multiple input variables, it is referred to as a multivariate function and the input variables can be thought of as a vector. In turn, the derivative of a multivariate target function may also be taken as a vector and is referred to generally as the &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient\">gradient</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gradient</strong>: First-order derivative for a multivariate objective function.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The derivative or the gradient points in the direction of the steepest ascent of the target function for a specific input.</p>\n<p>Gradient descent refers to a minimization optimization algorithm that follows the negative of the gradient downhill of the target function to locate the minimum of the function.</p>\n<p>The gradient descent algorithm requires a target function that is being optimized and the derivative function for the objective function. The target function <em>f()</em> returns a score for a given set of inputs, and the derivative function <em>f'()</em> gives the derivative of the target function for a given set of inputs.</p>\n<p>The gradient descent algorithm requires a starting point (<em>x</em>) in the problem, such as a randomly selected point in the input space.</p>\n<p>The derivative is then calculated and a step is taken in the input space that is expected to result in a downhill movement in the target function, assuming we are minimizing the target function.</p>\n<p>A downhill movement is made by first calculating how far to move in the input space, calculated as the step size (called <em>alpha</em> or the <em>learning rate</em>) multiplied by the gradient. This is then subtracted from the current point, ensuring we move against the gradient, or down the target function.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>x = x &#8211; step_size * f'(x)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The steeper the objective function at a given point, the larger the magnitude of the gradient and, in turn, the larger the step taken in the search space. The size of the step taken is scaled using a step size hyperparameter.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Step Size</strong> (<em>alpha</em>): Hyperparameter that controls how far to move in the search space against the gradient each iteration of the algorithm, also called the learning rate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the step size is too small, the movement in the search space will be small and the search will take a long time. If the step size is too large, the search may bounce around the search space and skip over the optima.</p>\n<p>Now that we are familiar with the gradient descent optimization algorithm, let&#8217;s take a look at momentum.</p>\n<h2>Momentum</h2>\n<p>Momentum is an extension to the gradient descent optimization algorithm, often referred to as <strong>gradient descent with momentum</strong>.</p>\n<p>It is designed to accelerate the optimization process, e.g. decrease the number of function evaluations required to reach the optima, or to improve the capability of the optimization algorithm, e.g. result in a better final result.</p>\n<p>A problem with the gradient descent algorithm is that the progression of the search can bounce around the search space based on the gradient. For example, the search may progress downhill towards the minima, but during this progression, it may move in another direction, even uphill, depending on the gradient of specific points (sets of parameters) encountered during the search.</p>\n<p>This can slow down the progress of the search, especially for those optimization problems where the broader trend or shape of the search space is more useful than specific gradients along the way.</p>\n<p>One approach to this problem is to add history to the parameter update equation based on the gradient encountered in the previous updates.</p>\n<p>This change is based on the metaphor of momentum from physics where acceleration in a direction can be accumulated from past updates.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The name momentum derives from a physical analogy, in which the negative gradient is a force moving a particle through parameter space, according to Newton’s laws of motion.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; Page 296, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3qSk3C2\">Deep Learning</a>, 2016.</p>\n<p>Momentum involves adding an additional hyperparameter that controls the amount of history (momentum) to include in the update equation, i.e. the step to a new point in the search space. The value for the hyperparameter is defined in the range 0.0 to 1.0 and often has a value close to 1.0, such as 0.8, 0.9, or 0.99. A momentum of 0.0 is the same as gradient descent without momentum.</p>\n<p>First, let&#8217;s break the gradient descent update equation down into two parts: the calculation of the change to the position and the update of the old position to the new position.</p>\n<p>The change in the parameters is calculated as the gradient for the point scaled by the step size.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>change_x = step_size * f'(x)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The new position is calculated by simply subtracting the change from the current point</p>\n<ul>\n<li>x = x &#8211; change_x</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Momentum involves maintaining the change in the position and using it in the subsequent calculation of the change in position.</p>\n<p>If we think of updates over time, then the update at the current iteration or time (t) will add the change used at the previous time (t-1) weighted by the momentum hyperparameter, as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>change_x(t) = step_size * f'(x(t-1)) + momentum * change_x(t-1)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The update to the position is then performed as before.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>x(t) = x(t-1) &#8211; change_x(t)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The change in the position accumulates magnitude and direction of changes over the iterations of the search, proportional to the size of the momentum hyperparameter.</p>\n<p>For example, a large momentum (e.g. 0.9) will mean that the update is strongly influenced by the previous update, whereas a modest momentum (0.2) will mean very little influence.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The momentum algorithm accumulates an exponentially decaying moving average of past gradients and continues to move in their direction.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; Page 296, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3qSk3C2\">Deep Learning</a>, 2016.</p>\n<p>Momentum has the effect of dampening down the change in the gradient and, in turn, the step size with each new point in the search space.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Momentum can increase speed when the cost surface is highly nonspherical because it damps the size of the steps along directions of high curvature thus yielding a larger effective learning rate along the directions of low curvature.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; Page 21, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ac5S4Q\">Neural Networks: Tricks of the Trade</a>, 2012.</p>\n<p>Momentum is most useful in optimization problems where the objective function has a large amount of curvature (e.g. changes a lot), meaning that the gradient may change a lot over relatively small regions of the search space.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The method of momentum is designed to accelerate learning, especially in the face of high curvature, small but consistent gradients, or noisy gradients.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; Page 296, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3qSk3C2\">Deep Learning</a>, 2016.</p>\n<p>It is also helpful when the gradient is estimated, such as from a simulation, and may be noisy, e.g. when the gradient has a high variance.</p>\n<p>Finally, momentum is helpful when the search space is flat or nearly flat, e.g. zero gradient. The momentum allows the search to progress in the same direction as before the flat spot and helpfully cross the flat region.</p>\n<p>Now that we are familiar with what momentum is, let&#8217;s look at a worked example.</p>\n<h2>Gradient Descent with Momentum</h2>\n<p>In this section, we will first implement the gradient descent optimization algorithm, then update it to use momentum and compare results.</p>\n<h3>One-Dimensional Test Problem</h3>\n<p>First, let&#8217;s define an optimization function.</p>\n<p>We will use a simple one-dimensional function that squares the input and defines the range of valid inputs from -1.0 to 1.0.</p>\n<p>The <em>objective()</em> function below implements this function.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\"># objective function\r\ndef objective(x):\r\n\treturn x**2.0</pre><p>We can then sample all inputs in the range and calculate the objective function value for each.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">...\r\n# define range for input\r\nr_min, r_max = -1.0, 1.0\r\n# sample input range uniformly at 0.1 increments\r\ninputs = arange(r_min, r_max+0.1, 0.1)\r\n# compute targets\r\nresults = objective(inputs)</pre><p>Finally, we can create a line plot of the inputs (x-axis) versus the objective function values (y-axis) to get an intuition for the shape of the objective function that we will be searching.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">...\r\n# create a line plot of input vs result\r\npyplot.plot(inputs, results)\r\n# show the plot\r\npyplot.show()</pre><p>The example below ties this together and provides an example of plotting the one-dimensional test function.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\"># plot of simple function\r\nfrom numpy import arange\r\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot\r\n\r\n# objective function\r\ndef objective(x):\r\n\treturn x**2.0\r\n\r\n# define range for input\r\nr_min, r_max = -1.0, 1.0\r\n# sample input range uniformly at 0.1 increments\r\ninputs = arange(r_min, r_max+0.1, 0.1)\r\n# compute targets\r\nresults = objective(inputs)\r\n# create a line plot of input vs result\r\npyplot.plot(inputs, results)\r\n# show the plot\r\npyplot.show()</pre><p>Running the example creates a line plot of the inputs to the function (x-axis) and the calculated output of the function (y-axis).</p>\n<p>We can see the familiar U-shape called a parabola.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_12090\" style=\"width: 1290px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-12090\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-12090\" src=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Line-Plot-of-Simple-One-Dimensional-Function-2.png\" alt=\"Line Plot of Simple One Dimensional Function\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" srcset=\"https://3qeqpr26caki16dnhd19sv6by6v-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Line-Plot-of-Simple-One-Dimensional-Function-2.png 1280w, https://3qeqpr26caki16dnhd19sv6by6v-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Line-Plot-of-Simple-One-Dimensional-Function-2-300x225.png 300w, https://3qeqpr26caki16dnhd19sv6by6v-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Line-Plot-of-Simple-One-Dimensional-Function-2-1024x768.png 1024w, https://3qeqpr26caki16dnhd19sv6by6v-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Line-Plot-of-Simple-One-Dimensional-Function-2-768x576.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-12090\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Line Plot of Simple One Dimensional Function</p></div>\n<h2>Gradient Descent Optimization</h2>\n<p>Next, we can apply the gradient descent algorithm to the problem.</p>\n<p>First, we need a function that calculates the derivative for the objective function.</p>\n<p>The derivative of x^2 is x * 2 and the <em>derivative()</em> function implements this below.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\"># derivative of objective function\r\ndef derivative(x):\r\n\treturn x * 2.0</pre><p>We can define a function that implements the gradient descent optimization algorithm.</p>\n<p>The procedure involves starting with a randomly selected point in the search space, then calculating the gradient, updating the position in the search space, evaluating the new position, and reporting the progress.

Networks</h2>\n<p><strong>Weight initialization</strong> is an important consideration in the design of a neural network model.</p>\n<p>The nodes in neural networks are composed of parameters referred to as weights used to calculate a weighted sum of the inputs.</p>\n<p>Neural network models are fit using an optimization algorithm called stochastic gradient descent that incrementally changes the network weights to minimize a loss function, hopefully resulting in a set of weights for the mode that is capable of making useful predictions.</p>\n<p>This optimization algorithm requires a starting point in the space of possible weight values from which to begin the optimization process. Weight initialization is a procedure to set the weights of a neural network to small random values that define the starting point for the optimization (learning or training) of the neural network model.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230; training deep models is a sufficiently difficult task that most algorithms are strongly affected by the choice of initialization. The initial point can determine whether the algorithm converges at all, with some initial points being so unstable that the algorithm encounters numerical difficulties and fails altogether.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; Page 301, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3qSk3C2\">Deep Learning</a>, 2016.</p>\n<p>Each time, a neural network is initialized with a different set of weights, resulting in a different starting point for the optimization process, and potentially resulting in a different final set of weights with different performance characteristics.</p>\n<p>For more on the expectation of different results each time the same algorithm is trained on the same dataset, see the tutorial:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/different-results-each-time-in-machine-learning/\">Why Do I Get Different Results Each Time in Machine Learning?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We cannot initialize all weights to the value 0.0 as the optimization algorithm results in some asymmetry in the error gradient to begin searching effectively.</p>\n<p>For more on why we initialize neural networks with random weights, see the tutorial:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/why-initialize-a-neural-network-with-random-weights/\">Why Initialize a Neural Network With Random Weights?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Historically, weight initialization follows simple heuristics, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Small random values in the range [-0.3, 0.3]</li>\n<li>Small random values in the range [0, 1]</li>\n<li>Small random values in the range [-1, 1]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These heuristics continue to work well in general.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We almost always initialize all the weights in the model to values drawn randomly from a Gaussian or uniform distribution. The choice of Gaussian or uniform distribution does not seem to matter very much, but has not been exhaustively studied. The scale of the initial distribution, however, does have a large effect on both the outcome of the optimization procedure and on the ability of the network to generalize.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; Page 302, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3qSk3C2\">Deep Learning</a>, 2016.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, more tailored approaches have been developed over the last decade that have become the defacto standard given they may result in a slightly more effective optimization (model training) process.</p>\n<p>These modern weight initialization techniques are divided based on the type of activation function used in the nodes that are being initialized, such as &#8220;<em>Sigmoid and Tanh</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>ReLU</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Next, let&#8217;s take a closer look at these modern weight initialization heuristics for nodes with Sigmoid and Tanh activation functions.</p>\n<h2>Weight Initialization for Sigmoid and Tanh</h2>\n<p>The current standard approach for initialization of the weights of neural network layers and nodes that use the Sigmoid or TanH activation function is called &#8220;<em>glorot</em>&#8221; or &#8220;<em>xavier</em>&#8221; initialization.</p>\n<p>It is named for <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/xglorot/\">Xavier Glorot</a>, currently a research scientist at Google DeepMind, and was described in the 2010 paper by Xavier and Yoshua Bengio titled &#8220;<a href=\"http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a.html\">Understanding The Difficulty Of Training Deep Feedforward Neural Networks</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There are two versions of this weight initialization method, which we will refer to as &#8220;<em>xavier</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>normalized xavier</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>Glorot and Bengio proposed to adopt a properly scaled uniform distribution for initialization. This is called “Xavier” initialization [&#8230;] Its derivation is based on the assumption that the activations are linear.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*G4YPr8NSZ5wlTYnGbxUMuQ.png\" /></figure><p>Happy New Year! It’s time to review the big trends in JavaScript and technology in 2020 and consider our momentum going into 2021.</p><p>Our aim is to highlight the learning topics and technologies with the highest potential job ROI. This is not about which ones are best, but which ones have the most potential to land you (or keep you in) a great job in 2021. We’ll also look at some larger tech trends towards the end.</p><h3>Language Rankings</h3><p>JavaScript still reigns supreme on GitHub and Stack Overflow. Tip #1: Learn JavaScript, and in particular, <a href=\"https://medium.com/javascript-scene/composing-software-the-book-f31c77fc3ddc\">learn functional programming in JavaScript</a>. Most of JavaScript’s top frameworks, including <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a>, <a href=\"https://redux.js.org/\">Redux</a>, <a href=\"https://lodash.com/\">Lodash</a>, and <a href=\"https://ramdajs.com/\">Ramda</a>, are grounded in functional programming concepts.</p><p>TypeScript jumped past PHP, and C# into 4th place, behind only Java, Python, and JavaScript. Python climbed past Java for 2nd place, perhaps on the strength of the rapidly climbing interest in AI and the <a href=\"https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch\">PyTorch library</a> for GPU-accelerated dynamic, deep neural networks, which makes experimentation with network structures easier and faster.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/928/1*iHNGDV62hwAwyH1bhPJTzA.png\" /><figcaption>Source: GitHub State of the Octoverse, 2020</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020\">JavaScript is also #1 on Stack Overflow</a> for the 8th year in a row. Python, Java, C#, PHP, and TypeScript beat out languages like C++, C, Go, Kotlin, and Ruby.</p><h3>Frameworks</h3><p>When it comes to front-end frameworks, a large majority of JavaScript developers use React, Vue.js, or Angular. jQuery still makes a surprisingly large showing, almost double the Vue.js showings, but it’s my guess that jQuery is used less in application work, and more in content sites and WordPress templates, so we’re going to exclude it this year.</p><h4>Search Volume</h4><p>React dominates search volume at 57.5%, with Angular collecting a large 31.5% share, and Vue.js picking up a respectable 11% slice.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*d6JAgTJpH10hZLE5tsmzHw.png\" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/\">Google Trends</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong><em>*Methodology: </em></strong><em>All search trends were selected by topic rather than by keyword to exclude false positives.</em></p><h4>Jobs</h4><p>If you want to learn the framework that will give you the best odds of landing a job in 2021, your best bet is still React, and has been since 2017. React is mentioned in 47.6% of the listings which mention a common front-end framework, Angular picks up 41.2%, and Vue.js trails at 11.2%.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*xMWh_sQMH4ebPGHVyHVmzA.png\" /></figure><p>It’s important to mention that most job listings say that they require experience with one of a few named frameworks, but <em>a large share of those listings are actually hiring for React work when you look at their listed tech stack,</em> and will show preference to candidates with a strong knowledge of React. You’ll see some supporting evidence of that in the download trends, below.</p><p><strong><em>*Methodology:</em></strong><em> Job searches were conducted on Indeed.com. To weed out false positives, I paired searches with the keyword “software” to strengthen the chance of relevance. I also omitted the “.js” from “Vue.js” because many listings don’t include the “.js”. All SERPS were sorted by date and spot checked for relevance.</em></p><h4>Downloads</h4><p>The npm download counts look fairly similar to the search trends, but reveal something interesting: The number of downloads for Angular 2+ and Vue.js are pretty much neck-and-neck, but if you add in the number of people using the old Angular framework, Angular has a solid lead over Vue.js in downloads.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WY5BITd-JkdGpoq30gqc2w.png\" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https://www.npmtrends.com/@angular/core-vs-react-vs-vue-vs-angular\">npmtrends.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>If we look at recent download shares on a pie chart, it shows React at ~66%, Angular (all versions) at ~20%, and Vue at ~15%.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*3u6Et7PAAhCUwDXjxQfm5g.png\" /></figure><h4>TypeScript vs JavaScript</h4><p>10.6% of employers specifically mention TypeScript in job listings, up from 7.4% last year.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*BHCJko8Auot0CNHhu5zvog.png\" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https://www.indeed.com/\">Indeed.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>Developer interest in TypeScript is undeniably strong, and growing rapidly. I predict that this trend will continue in 2021, and users will learn to work around some of <a href=\"https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-typescript-tax-132ff4cb175b\">the costs of using TypeScript</a> (for example, by favoring interfaces over inline type annotations).</p><p>The number of jobs that specifically mention TypeScript is still relatively small, but some experience with TypeScript will slightly increase your odds of landing a job in 2021. By 2022, some experience with TypeScript might give you an edge in the job market. However, because it’s easier for a JavaScript developer to learn TypeScript than a completely new language, TypeScript teams are usually willing to hire and train good JavaScript developers.</p><h4>Server Frameworks</h4><p>On the server side, Express still dominates in download counts, so much so that it’s difficult to see how popular contenders are doing relative to each other.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IIggnRioxdg00DnxSH-eEA.png\" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https://www.npmtrends.com/@angular/core-vs-react-vs-vue-vs-angular\">npmtrends.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>As I predicted last year, excluding express, we see that <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\">Next.js</a> has emerged as the top contender, which is unsurprising because Next.js is a flexible, full-stack, React-based framework which can help you deliver statically optimized content, but can also fall-back on serverless functions for API routes and SSR when you need to generate content dynamically. You can even statically generate content on-demand the first time it’s requested, and subsequently serve cached static content served from CDN — useful for apps based on user-generated content.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*cyI8k2iwLMWs8Sd2Hf6T3A.png\" /></figure><p>Next has many other advantages, including automatic optimization of page bundles, automatic image optimization with the <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image\">new Image tag</a> and built-in <a href=\"https://vercel.com/docs/next.js/analytics\">performance analytics</a> to help you improve your user’s page load experience.</p><p>If you use GitHub and deploy on <a href=\"https://vercel.com/\">Vercel</a>, you’ll also get automatic deploys for every PR, and a buttery smooth CI/CD pipeline. Essentially, it’s like having the best full-time DevOps team on staff, but instead of paying them salaries, you save a significant amount of money in hosting bills.</p><p>Expect Next.js to continue to explode in 2021.</p><h3>Remote Work Trends</h3><p>In 2020, teams were forced to learn to collaborate remotely by a global pandemic. In 2021, remote work will continue to be an important topic. First, because it will <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-covid-19-vaccine-when-will-it-be-available-for-you-11606339361\">probably be June</a> before vaccination against COVID-19 is widespread, and second, because a lot of teams experienced increased productivity and reduced costs during lockdown, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/01/twitter-work-from-home/?arc404=true\">many</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/technology/facebook-remote-work-coronavirus.html\">employees</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/13/success/dropbox-virtual-first-future-of-work/index.html\">will</a> <a href=\"https://blog.coinbase.com/post-covid-19-coinbase-will-be-a-remote-first-company-cdac6e621df7\">not</a> <a href=\"https://www.rei.com/newsroom/article/rei-co-op-to-pursue-sale-of-headquarters-embrace-distributed-work-model\">return</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/25/business/office-space-remote-work-pandemic/index.html\">to offices</a> in 2021.</p><p>Remote work has also led to more location freedom, prompting developers to move to places where they have access to things that are important to them, such as family and more affordable housing. Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/25/business/office-space-remote-work-pandemic/index.html\">72% of employers surveyed by KPMG</a> said that remote work has widened their potential talent pool.</p><blockquote>Remote-first and hybrid-remote teams will be the new normal in the new decade.</blockquote><p>Average JavaScript Developer salaries dipped slightly in 2020, from $114k/year to $113k/year, according to Indeed, perhaps due in part to remote work expanding the employee pool beyond tech centers like San Francisco and New York, which tend to have a much higher cost of living, and demand higher salaries to compensate. The <a href=\"https://www.indeed.com/career/javascript-developer/salaries/San-Francisco--CA\">average JavaScript Developer salary in San Francisco is $130k</a>.</p><p>Still, lots of companies with roots in San Francisco and other tech centers are paying remote workers somewhere between the US national average and San Francisco pay, which provides a premium on market rates to attract better talent, and still saves money over hiring locally and paying for office space.</p><p>Because of this trend, lots of remote jobs exist in the $115k — $130k range for mid-level developers. Senior developers often find jobs in the $120k — $150k range, <em>regardless of location.</em></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/695/1*wgH1ZpTefhEuCWz_Ftk8Tg.png\" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/senior-javascript-developer-Salary-in-San-Francisco,CA?ind=null\">ZipRecruiter</a></figcaption></figure><p>GitHub data suggests that rather than slowing down, teams were more productive working remotely in 2020. GitHub activity spiked when lockdowns began.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/816/1*9RTQtnKqFfrZ8ua5_rmPfg.png\" /><figcaption>Source: GitHub State of the Octoverse, 2020</figcaption></figure><p>Volume of work on GitHub increased substantially, and average pull request merge times dropped by 7.5 hours.</p><p>Toss that onto the growing pile of evidence that<em> remote work works.</em></p><h3>Passwords are Obsolete</h3><p><strong><em>Passwords are obsolete, insecure technology and absolutely should not be used to protect your users or your app in 2021.</em></strong></p><p>The crux of the matter is that about half of all users reuse passwords on multiple applications and websites, and attackers are financially incentivized to bring massive computing power to the problem of cracking your user’s passwords so they can try them on bank accounts, Amazon, etc.</p><p>If you’re not Google, Microsoft, or Amazon, chances are you can’t afford the computing power required to defend against modern password crackers. Don’t believe me? Check out <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/\">HaveIBeenPwned</a>. Spoiler: If you’ve used the internet, your passwords have been stolen.</p><p>I’ve been warning about the dangers of passwords for years, but in 2020, <a href=\"https://magic.link/\">new options</a> <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-1/\">emerged</a> which allow us to leave passwords behind, permanently. It was true in 2020, and it remains true: No new app should use passwords in 2021.</p><p>But once you leave passwords behind in exchange for cryptographic key pairs, your app also gains Web3 superpowers. Which leads me to the next topic: Crypto.</p><h3>Crypto</h3><p>Crypto will continue to be one of the most important and globally transformational technologies in 2021. Here are some highlights from 2020:</p><ul><li><strong>Bitcoin exploded</strong> to new all time highs, thanks in part to notable support from companies like PayPal. Expect more of the same in 2021.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-2-0-beacon-chain-goes-live-as-world-computer-begins-long-awaited-overhaul\"><strong>Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain launched</strong></a><strong>,</strong> which lays the groundwork for Ethereum to become a much more scalable platform. Additionally, scalability solutions such as <a href=\"https://matic.network/\">side-chains</a> and <a href=\"https://zksync.io/faq/intro.html#introduction\">zkRollups</a> gained momentum in 2020. Expect to see more DApps (Decentralized Apps) integrate those scaling solutions in 2021.</li><li><strong>DeFi (Decentralized Finanance) is now a </strong><a href=\"https://defipulse.com/\"><strong>$15 billion</strong></a><strong> market</strong> (up from $650 million when I wrote last year’s edition of this post), mostly operating on the Ethereum blockchain. Many multi-million-dollar exploits plagued the DeFi ecosystem in 2020. Smart contract security will continue to be a hot topic and huge opportunity in 2021.</li><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token\"><strong>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)</strong></a><strong> gained momentum</strong> in 2020, with several high profile sales of single tokens priced in the tens of thousands of dollars, each. <a href=\"https://rarible.com/\">Rarible</a> introduced their own community token and began to airdrop it to marketplace users, fueling increased volume. Millions of dollar’s worth of NFTs are bought and sold daily, but this is just the beginning. Because they can represent virtually anything of value, the total addressable market is in the $trillions.</li><li><strong>The </strong><a href=\"https://www.onflow.org/post/a-year-in-review-with-flow-2020\"><strong>Flow blockchain launched</strong></a> and brought with it lots of promise for mainstream blockchain adoption. <strong>NBA Top Shot has sold over $6 million</strong> in NBA-branded NFT moments, which represent short video clips of key moments in NBA games.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.thetatoken.org/\"><strong>Theta Network</strong></a><strong> launched smart contracts and NFTs.</strong> Among other things, NFTs will be used for stickers and badges on <a href=\"https://www.theta.tv/\">Theta.tv</a>, a decentralized alternative to Twitch with millions of monthly active users.</li></ul><h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><p>2020 was a seminal year for AI. Via the GPT-3 launch, we learned that language models and transformers in general may be a viable path towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).</p><p>The human mind’s ability to generally solve a wide variety of problems by relating them to things we already know is known in AI circles as zero-shot and few-shot learning. We don’t need a lot of instruction or examples to take on tasks that are new to us. We can often figure out new kinds of problems with just a few (or no) examples (shots).</p><p>That general applicability of human cognitive skills is known as general intelligence. In AI, Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is “the hypothetical intelligence of a machine that has the capacity to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can.”</p><p>GPT-3 demonstrated that it could teach itself math, how to code, how to translate text, and a virtually infinite variety of other skills via its gigantic training set which includes basically the whole public web (<a href=\"https://commoncrawl.org/the-data/get-started/\">Common Crawl</a>, WebText2, Books1, Books2, and Wikipedia), combined with its enormous model size. GPT-3 uses 175 billion parameters. For context, that’s an order of magnitude (10x) the previous state of the art, but still orders of magnitude smaller than the human brain.</p><p>Scaling up GPT-3 is likely to lead to even more breakthroughs in what it is capable of.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FPqbB07n_uQ4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DPqbB07n_uQ4&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FPqbB07n_uQ4%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/d8caa7f83df0ef3115dda01c85e2cb1d/href\">https://medium.com/media/d8caa7f83df0ef3115dda01c85e2cb1d/href</a></iframe><h4>Self Driving Cars</h4><p>In October 2020, Waymo began offering fully driverless rides (with no human in the driver seat) on 100% of their rides.

Researchers are making rapid progress, but quantum computing still requires extremely expensive hardware, and there are only a small handful of quantum computers in the world that have achieved any kind of quantum superiority.</p><p>Quantum-resistant cryptography, quantum-assisted cryptography, and <a href=\"https://medium.com/cambridge-quantum-computing/quantum-natural-language-processing-748d6f27b31d\">quantum computing for machine learning</a> are potential areas of focus where breakthroughs would have a significant industry-spanning, global impact. I believe that one day, the application of quantum computing in the field of AI will propel the technology forward many orders of magnitude — a feat that will have a profound impact on the human race.</p><p>In my opinion, that is unlikely to happen in the 2020s, but I expect to hear more quantum supremacy announcements in 2021, and perhaps breakthroughs in the variety of algorithms state of the art quantum computers can compute.

Given the same props, always render the same data.</blockquote><p>When React was first introduced, it fundamentally changed how JavaScript frameworks worked. While everyone else was pushing MVC, MVVM, etc, React chose to isolate view rendering from the model representation and introduce a completely new architecture to the JavaScript front-end ecosystem: Flux.</p><p>Why did the React team do that? Why was it better than the MVC frameworks (and jQuery spaghetti) that came before?</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FGW0rj4sNH2w%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DGW0rj4sNH2w&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FGW0rj4sNH2w%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/9e606b202853dde24593cce504a13e10/href\">https://medium.com/media/9e606b202853dde24593cce504a13e10/href</a></iframe><p>In the year 2013, Facebook had just spent quite a bit of effort integrating the chat feature: A feature that would be live and available across the app experience, integrating on virtually every page of the site. It was a complex app within an already complex app, and uncontrolled mutation of the DOM, along with the parallel and asynchronous nature of multi-user I/O presented difficult challenges for the Facebook team.</p><p>For instance, how can you predict what is going to be rendered to the screen when anything can grab the DOM and mutate it at any time for any reason, and how can you prove that what got rendered was correct?</p><p>You couldn’t make those guarantees with any of the popular front-end frameworks prior to React. DOM race conditions were one of the most common bugs in early web applications.</p><blockquote>“<strong><em>Non-determinism = parallel processing + mutable state</em></strong>” — <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Odersky\">Martin Odersky</a></blockquote><p>Job #1 of the React team was to fix that problem. They did that with two key innovations:</p><ul><li><strong>Unidirectional data binding</strong> with the flux architecture.</li><li><strong>Component state is immutable.</strong> Once set, the state of a component can’t be changed. State changes don’t change existing view state. Instead, they trigger a new view render with a new state.</li></ul><blockquote>“The simplest way that we have found, conceptually, to structure and render our views, is to just try to avoid mutation altogether.” — Tom Occhino, JSConfUS 2013</blockquote><p>With flux, React tamed the uncontrolled mutation problem. Instead of attaching event listeners to any arbitrary number of arbitrary objects (models) to trigger DOM updates, React introduced a single way to manipulate a component’s state: Dispatch to a store. When the store state changes, the store will ask the component to re-render.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/875/1*lNLcKqywLkrHadcA-zhgBA.png\" /><figcaption>Flux architecture</figcaption></figure><p>When I’m asked “why should I care about React”, my answer is simple: Because we want <strong>deterministic view renders,</strong> and React makes that a lot easier.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> It is an anti-pattern to read data from the DOM for the purpose of implementing domain logic. Doing so defeats the purpose of using React. Instead, read data from your store and make those choices prior to render-time.</blockquote><p>If deterministic render was React’s only trick, it would still be an amazing innovation. But the React team wasn’t done innovating. They launched with several more killer features, and over the years, they’ve added even more.</p><h3>JSX</h3><p>JSX is an extension to JavaScript which allows you to declaratively create custom UI components. JSX has important benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Easy, declarative markup.</strong></li><li><strong>Colocated with your component.</strong></li><li><strong>Separate by concern,</strong> (e.g., UI vs state logic, vs side-effects) not by <strong>technology</strong> (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript).</li><li><strong>Abstract away DOM differences.</strong></li><li><strong>Abstract away from underlying tech </strong>so you can target many different platforms with React. (e.g., <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/\">ReactNative</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-360\">VR</a>, <a href=\"https://netflixtechblog.com/crafting-a-high-performance-tv-user-interface-using-react-3350e5a6ad3b\">Netflix Gibbon</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/raphamorim/react-ape\">Canvas/WebGL</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/chromakode/react-html-email\">email</a>, ...)</li></ul><p>Prior to JSX, if you wanted to write declarative UI code, you had to use HTML templates, and there was no good standard for it at the time. Every framework used their own special syntax you had to learn to do things like loop over data, interpolate variables, or do conditional branching.</p><p>Today, if you look at other frameworks, you still have to learn special syntax like the *ngFor directive from Angular. Since JSX is a superset of JavaScript, you get all of JavaScript’s existing features included in your JSX markup.</p><p>You can iterate over items with Array.prototype.map, use logic operators, branch with ternary expressions, <a href=\"https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-pure-function-d1c076bec976\">call pure functions</a>, interpolate over <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals\">template literals</a>, or generally anything else a JavaScript expression can do. In my opinion, this is a huge advantage over competing UI frameworks.</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/8d43814b882b08d21c597884b4ca3959/href\">https://medium.com/media/8d43814b882b08d21c597884b4ca3959/href</a></iframe><p>There are a couple rules you may struggle with at first:</p><ul><li>The class attribute becomes className in JSX.</li><li>For every item in a list of items you want to display, you need a stable, unique identifier to use for the JSX key attribute. The key must not change when items are added or removed. In practice, most list items have unique ids in your data model, and those usually work great as keys.</li></ul><p>React didn’t prescribe a single solution for CSS. You can pass a JavaScript style object to the style property, in which case, many common style names are converted to camelCase for the object literal form, but there are other options. I mix and match a couple different solutions, depending on the scope I want for the style I’m applying: global styles for theming and common layouts, and local scoped for this component only.</p><p>Here are my favorite options:</p><ul><li><strong>CSS files</strong> can be loaded in your page header for common global layouts, fonts, etc. They work fine.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules\"><strong>CSS modules</strong></a> are locally scoped CSS files that you can import directly in your JavaScript files. You’ll need a properly configured <a href=\"https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader\">loader</a>. <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\">Next.js</a> enables this by default.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx\"><strong>styled-jsx</strong></a> lets you declare styles inline in your React components, similar to how &lt;style&gt; tags work in HTML. The scope for those styles is hyper-local, meaning that only sibling tags and their children will be affected by the styles. Next.js also enables styled-jsx by default.</li></ul><h3>Synthetic Events</h3><p>React provides a wrapper around the DOM events called synthetic events. They are very cool for several reasons. Synthetic events:</p><ol><li><strong>Smooth over cross-platform differences</strong> in event handling, making it easier to make your JS code work in every browser.</li><li><strong>Are automatically memory managed.</strong> If you were going to make an infinitely scrolling list in raw JavaScript + HTML, you would need to delegate events or hook and unhook event listeners as elements scroll on and off the screen in order to avoid memory leaks. Synthetic events are automatically delegated to the root node, meaning React developers get event memory management for free.</li></ol><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Prior to React v17, it’s not possible to access synthetic event properties in asynchronous functions because of event pooling. Instead, grab the data you need from the event object and reference it in your closure environment. <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/08/10/react-v17-rc.html\">Event pooling was removed in v17</a> because browser optimizations take care of it.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Prior to v17, synthetic events were delegated to the document node. After v17, synthetic events are delegated to the React root node.</blockquote><h3>Component Lifecycle</h3><p>The React component lifecycle exists to protect component state. Component state must not be mutated while React is drawing the component. Instead, a component gets into a known state, draws, and then opens up the lifecycle for effects, state updates, and events.</p><p>Understanding the lifecycle is key to understanding how to do things the React way, so you won’t fight with React, or accidentally defeat the purpose of using in the first place by improperly mutating or reading state from the DOM.</p><p>Beginning at React 0.14, React introduced class syntax to hook into React’s component lifecycle. React has two different lifecycles to think about: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/336/1*xRzCfozCPTWXp8wgnZrXiA.png\" /><figcaption>React Lifecycle</figcaption></figure><p>And then within the update lifecycle, there are three more phases:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/360/1*9wk48udC9l884fOZydImiw.png\" /><figcaption>React Update Cycle</figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Render</strong> — aside from calling hooks, your render function should be deterministic and have no side-effects. You should usually think of it as a pure function from props to JSX.</li><li><strong>Pre-Commit</strong> — Here you can read from the DOM using the getSnapShotBeforeUpdate lifecycle method. Useful if you need to read things like scroll position or the rendered size of an element before the DOM re-renders.</li><li><strong>Commit </strong>— During the commit phase, React updates the DOM and refs. You can tap into it using componentDidUpdate or the useEffect hook. This is where it’s OK to run effects, schedule updates, use the DOM, etc.</li></ul><p>Dan Abramov made a great diagram that spells out all the details as you might see it from the React class perspective:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*cEWErpe-oY-_S1dOaT1NtA.jpeg\" /><figcaption>React Component Lifecycle Diagram by Dan Abramov (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/981712092611989509\">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>In my opinion, thinking of a component as a long-lived class is not the best mental model for how React works. Remember: React component state is not meant to be mutated. It’s meant to be replaced, and each replacement of the current state triggers a re-render. This enables what is arguably React’s best feature: Making it easy to create <strong>deterministic view renders.</strong></p><p>A better mental model for that behavior is that every time React renders, it calls a deterministic function that returns JSX. That function should not directly invoke its own side effects, but can queue up effects for React to run.</p><p>In other words, you should think of most React components as pure functions from props to JSX.</p><p><strong>A pure function:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Given same inputs, always returns the same output</strong> (deterministic).</li><li><strong>Has no side-effects </strong>(e.g., network I/O, logging to console, writing to localStorage, etc.)</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> If your component needs effects, use useEffect or call an <a href=\"https://medium.com/javascript-scene/10-tips-for-better-redux-architecture-69250425af44\">action creator</a> passed through props and handle the effects <a href=\"https://redux-saga.js.org/\">in middleware</a>.</blockquote><h3>React Hooks</h3><p>React 16.8 introduced a new concept: <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html\"><strong>React hooks</strong></a> are functions that allow you to tap into the React component lifecycle without using the class syntax or directly calling lifecycle methods. Instead of declaring a class, you write a render function.</p><p>Calling a hook generally introduces side-effects — effects which allow your component to hook into things like component state and I/O. A <strong>side-effect</strong> is any state change observable outside the function other than the function’s return value.</p><p><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html\">useEffect</a> lets you queue up effects to run at the appropriate time in the component lifecycle, which can be just after the component mounts (like <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentdidmount\">componentDidMount</a>), during the commit phase (like <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentdidupdate\">componentDidUpdate</a>), or just before the component unmounts (like <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentwillunmount\">componentWillUnmount</a>).</p><p>Notice how three different lifecycle methods fell out of a single React hook? That’s because instead of putting logic in lifecycle methods, hooks allow you to keep related logic together.</p><p>Many components need to hook something up when a component mounts, update it every time the component re-draws, and then clean up before the component unmounts to prevent memory leaks. With useEffect, you can do that all in one function call, instead of splitting your logic into 3 different methods, mixed with all the other unrelated logic that also needs to use those methods.</p><p><strong>Hooks enable you to:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Write your components as functions</strong> instead of classes.</li><li><strong>Organize your code better.</strong></li><li><strong>Share reusable logic</strong> between different components.</li><li><strong>Compose hooks </strong>to create your own custom hooks (call a hook from inside another hook).</li></ul><p>Generally speaking, you should favor function components and React hooks over class-based components. They will usually be less code, better organized, more readable, more reusable, and more testable.</p><h3>Container vs Presentation Components</h3><p>For better modularity and reusability of components, I tend to write my components in two parts:</p><ul><li><strong>Container components</strong> are components that are connected to the data store and may have side-effects.</li><li><strong>Presentation components</strong> are <em>mostly </em>pure components, which, given the same props and context, always return the same JSX.</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Tip:</strong> Pure components should not be confused with <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactpurecomponent\">React.PureComponent</a>, which is named after pure components because it’s unsafe to use it for components that aren’t pure.</blockquote><p><strong>Presentation components:</strong></p><ul><li>Don’t touch the network</li><li>Don’t save or load from localStorage</li><li>Don’t generate random data</li><li>Don’t read directly from the current system time (e.g., by calling a function like Date.now())</li><li>Don’t interact directly with the store</li><li><em>May</em> use local component state for things like form inputs, as long as you can pass in an initial state so that they can be deterministically tested</li></ul><p>That last point is why I call presentation components “mostly pure”. Once React takes control of the lifecycle, they’re essentially reading their component state from React global state. So hooks like useState and useReducer provide implicit data input (input sources that are not declared in the function signature) making them technically impure. If you want them to be really pure, you can delegate all state management responsibility to the container component, but IMO, it’s overkill as long as your component is still unit testable.</p><blockquote>“Perfect is the enemy of good” — Voltaire</blockquote><h4>Container Components</h4><p>Container components are components which handle state management, I/O, and any other effects. They should not render their own markup — instead, they delegate rendering to the presentation component they wrap. Typically, a container component in a React+Redux app would simply invoke mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps, and wrap the presentation component with the result. They may also compose in many cross-cutting concerns (see below).</p><h3>Higher Order Components</h3><p>A <strong>Higher Order Component (HOC)</strong> is a component which takes a component and returns a component in order to compose in additional functionality.</p><p>Higher Order Components work by wrapping a component around another component. The wrapping component adds some DOM or logic, and may or may not pass additional props into the wrapped component.</p><p>Unlike React hooks and <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html\">render props</a> components, HOCs are composable using standard function composition, so you can declaratively mix in shared behavior across all your app components without those components knowing that those behaviors exist. For example, here is an HOC from <a href=\"https://ericelliottjs.com\">EricElliottJS.com</a>:</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/65b0cc0981160e6d4085c8f22932a84e/href\">https://medium.com/media/65b0cc0981160e6d4085c8f22932a84e/href</a></iframe><p>This mixes in all the common, cross-cutting concerns shared by all the pages on <a href=\"https://ericelliottjs.com\">EricElliottJS.com</a>. withEnv pulls in environment settings, withAuth adds GitHub authentication, withLoader displays a spinner while user data is loading, withLayout({ showFooter: true }) displays our default layout with a footer at the bottom of the page, withFeatures loads our feature toggle settings, withRouter loads our router, withCoupon handles magic coupon links, and withMagicLink handles our passwordless user authentication with <a href=\"https://magic.link/\">Magic</a>.</p><blockquote>Tip: <a href=\"https://medium.com/javascript-scene/passwords-are-obsolete-how-to-secure-your-app-and-protect-your-users-1cd6c7b7c3bc\">Passwords are obsolete and dangerous</a>.

It consists of mounting, updating, and unmounting, and the updating phase consists of render, pre-commit, and commit phases.</li><li><strong>React hooks</strong> allow you to tap into the component lifecycle without using the class syntax, and also make it easier to share behaviors between components.</li><li><strong>Container and Presentation Components</strong> allow you to isolate presentation concerns from state and effects, making both your components and business logic more reusable and testable.</li><li><strong>Higher Order Components</strong> make it easy to share composable behaviors across many pages in your app in a way that your components don’t need to know about them (or be tightly coupled to them).</li></ul><h4>Next Steps</h4><p>We touched on a lot of functional programming concepts in this simple React introduction. If you really want to understand how to build React applications, it’s a good idea to reinforce your understanding of concepts such as <a href=\"https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-pure-function-d1c076bec976\">pure functions</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-dao-of-immutability-9f91a70c88cd\">immutability</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/javascript-scene/curry-and-function-composition-2c208d774983\">curried functions, partial application, and function composition</a>.

There is!</p><p>But even if I share it with you — even if I give it away and spell it out for you in detail— it might take you 10 years to grow into and fully appreciate the simplicity of it.</p><p>At least, that’s what happened to me. It was spelled out to me in plain English by my high school programming teacher. I was walked step-by-step through the process of applying it using some example code. And it didn’t really sink in until 10 years later. But now, with the benefit of experience, it’s a lesson I appreciate profoundly, and even though I know it’s a lesson you can’t truly appreciate at first glance — I’m going to share it with you.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fvideoseries%3Flist%3DPLWOdyjG6bHl54g4o3V-5ooeGnAfqWH6ja&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DF-JvvFlYcts&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FF-JvvFlYcts%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/445e221312cc03f7ec8311d1df4520b1/href\">https://medium.com/media/445e221312cc03f7ec8311d1df4520b1/href</a></iframe><p>This secret is a key difference between average productivity and 10x productivity. Using the leverage that this secret provides, you can be orders of magnitude more efficient.</p><p>You can write code that is more reusable and less likely to break when new requirements are introduced and things change in the surrounding code.</p><p>The secret to being 10x more productive is to gain a mastery of <strong>abstraction.</strong> A lot of developers treat “abstraction” like it’s a dirty word. You’ll hear (otherwise good) advice like, “don’t abstract too early” or Zen of Python’s famous “explicit is better than implicit,” implying that concrete is better than abstract. And all of that is good advice — depending on context.</p><p>But modern apps use a huge amount of code. If you printed out the source code of modern top 10 applications, those stacks of paper would compete with the height of skyscrapers, and software costs a lot of money to maintain. The more code you create, the more it costs.</p><h3>Abstraction is the Key to Simple Code</h3><p>The right abstractions can make code more readable, adaptable, and maintainable by hiding details which are unimportant for the current context, and reducing the amount of code required to do the same work — often by orders of magnitude.</p><blockquote>“Simplicity is about<br>subtracting the obvious<br>and adding the meaningful.”</blockquote><blockquote>~ John Maeda: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Laws-Simplicity-Design-Technology-Business/dp/0262134721/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=eejs-20&amp;linkId=d496ae0ff9297a950b4c93fd6dfb2c44&amp;language=en_US\">The Laws of Simplicity</a></blockquote><p>Abstraction is not a 1-way street. It’s really formed by two complementary concepts:</p><ul><li><strong>Generalization</strong> — Removing the repeated parts <em>(the obvious)</em> and hiding them behind an abstraction.</li><li><strong>Specialization</strong> — Applying the abstraction for a particular use-case, adding just what needs to be different <em>(the meaningful).</em></li></ul><p>Consider the following code:</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/7b6826c906976ed99a7dac19825608ae/href\">https://medium.com/media/7b6826c906976ed99a7dac19825608ae/href</a></iframe><p>There’s nothing inherently wrong with the code, but it contains a lot of details that may not be important for this particular application.</p><ul><li>It includes details of the container/transport data structure being used (the array), meaning that it will only work with arrays. It contains a <strong>state shape dependency.</strong></li><li>It includes the iteration logic, meaning that if you need other operations which also need to visit each element in the data structure, you’d need to repeat very similar iteration logic in that code, as well. It forces <strong>repetition </strong>which could violate<strong> DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself).</strong></li><li>It includes an explicit assignment, rather than declaratively describing the operation to be performed. <strong>It’s verbose.</strong></li></ul><p>None of that is necessary. All of it can be hidden behind an abstraction. In this case, an abstraction that is so universal, it has transformed the way modern applications are built and reduced the number of explicit for-loops we need to write.</p><blockquote>“If you touch one thing with deep awareness, you touch everything.”</blockquote><blockquote>~ <strong>Thich Nhat Hanh</strong></blockquote><p>Using the map operation, we can reduce the code to a one-liner by removing the obvious (the parts we’re likely to repeat in similar code), and focusing on the meaningful (just the stuff that needs to be different for our use case:</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/2404c9b2cd7784a57aab053f2b725f6d/href\">https://medium.com/media/2404c9b2cd7784a57aab053f2b725f6d/href</a></iframe><p><strong>Junior developers</strong> think they have to write a lot of code to produce a lot of value.</p><p><strong>Senior developers</strong> understand the value of the code that nobody needed to write.</p><p>Imagine being the coder who popularized the use of the map operation in programming languages like JavaScript. Map abstracts away details such as the type of data you’re mapping over, the type of data structure containing the data, and the iteration logic required to enumerate each data node in the data structure. It’s improved the efficiency of every app I’ve built in the past decade.</p><p><strong>Jeremy Ashkenas</strong> made several such operations popular in JavaScript, and paved the way for many of the great syntax shortcuts we take for granted now in JavaScript by pioneering their use in CoffeeScript. He made Underscore, which spawned Lodash (still the most popular functional programming utility belt in JavaScript), and Backbone, which popularized MVC architecture in JavaScript and set the stage for Angular and React.</p><p><strong>John Resig</strong> made jQuery, which was so popular and influential, it formed the biggest collection of reusable, encapsulated JavaScript modules (jQuery plugins) until standard Node modules and ES6 modules appeared several years later. jQuery’s selector API was so influential it forms the basis of today’s DOM selection APIs. I still benefit on a nearly daily basis from jQuery’s selection API <a href=\"https://medium.com/javascript-scene/unit-testing-react-components-aeda9a44aae2\">when I unit test React components</a>.</p><p>The right abstractions are powerful levers that can impact productivity dramatically. Abstraction is not a dirty word. Modules, functions, variables, classes — all of these are forms of abstraction and the entire reason any of them exist is to make abstraction and composition of abstractions <em>easier.</em></p><p>You can’t build complex software without abstractions. Even assembly language uses abstractions — names for instructions, variables for memory addresses, code points to jump to for subroutines (like function calls), etc. Modern software is a layer cake of useful abstractions, and those layers give you leverage.</p><blockquote>“Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.”</blockquote><blockquote>~ Archimedes</blockquote><p>The key to simplicity: The secret we’re after — is how to reduce the mountain of code we’re producing — how to get a lot more done with a lot less. When you master that, you will be a 10x programmer.

One of the things about Redux that commonly trips people up is that reducers must be pure functions.</p><p>A pure function is a function which:</p><ol><li>Given same arguments, always returns the same result, and</li><li>Has no side-effects (e.g., it won’t mutate its input arguments).</li></ol><p>The problem is that sometimes a reducer needs to make a complicated change to some input state, but you can’t just mutate the state argument without causing bugs.</p><p>The solution is a handy tool called <a href=\"https://github.com/immerjs/immer\">Immer</a>. In this video, I’ll introduce you to Immer and show you how to use it to reduce the complexity of your reducer code. With one or two small reducers, the difference is pretty subtle, but on a large project, it can significantly simplify your application code.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fvideoseries%3Flist%3DPLWOdyjG6bHl4UAFH5-HtS9ui1bkE5jMLp&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DC-hAqD6_OOk&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FC-hAqD6_OOk%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/40c75cf7bc8387edd94cd565d8d2817f/href\">https://medium.com/media/40c75cf7bc8387edd94cd565d8d2817f/href</a></iframe><p>Here’s an example. Imagine you’re building a social network, and you need to keep track of posts that a user has liked. When they like a post, you add a like object to the user’s likes collection. That might look something like this:</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/5bc907c246982f7410372f19660845ca/href\">https://medium.com/media/5bc907c246982f7410372f19660845ca/href</a></iframe><p>Notice what we’re returning from the like.type case: Mixing bits of the payload into a nested property of the state object using the JavaScript object spread syntax: ...state and ...state.likes on lines 19–25.</p><p>After immer, you can simplify that part to a one-liner (line 21):</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/42d062668c63a7b2d432555184919ed2/href\">https://medium.com/media/42d062668c63a7b2d432555184919ed2/href</a></iframe><p>The produce function returns a partial application (a function which has been partially applied to its arguments) which then takes the arguments of the reducer function. You pass it a callback function which takes a draft of the state object instead of the real state object. You’re free to mutate that object as if it were any other mutable object in JavaScript. No more spreading nested properties to avoid mutating the input argument.</p><p>After your callback function runs, Immer compares the draft to the original state and then builds a new object with your changes applied, so your function feels like it’s mutating, but still behaves like a pure function. You get the best of both worlds: The simplicity of mutation with the benefits of immutability.</p><h3>Next Steps</h3><p><a href=\"https://ericelliottjs.com/\">EricElliottJS.com</a> has in-depth lessons on topics like pure functions, immutability, partial applications, and other functional and object oriented programming concepts.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAbA0FivNSBqTmyYrh6uymQ\">Subscribe on YouTube</a>.</p><p><strong><em>Eric Elliott</em></strong><em> is a tech product and platform advisor, author of </em><a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fleanpub.com%2Fcomposingsoftware\"><em>“Composing Software”</em></a><em>, cofounder of </em><a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=http%3A%2F%2FEricElliottJS.com\"><em>EricElliottJS.com</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=http%3A%2F%2FDevAnywhere.io\"><em>DevAnywhere.io</em></a><em>, and dev team mentor.

Algebraic Data Types refer to complex types in programming languages (e.g., Rust, Haskell, F#) that display some properties of specific algebraic structures. e.g., sum types and product types.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Algebraic Structures.</strong> Algebraic structures are studied and applied from abstract algebra, which, like ADTs, are also commonly specified in terms of algebraic descriptions of axioms, but applicable far outside the world of computers and code. An algebraic structure can exist that is impossible to model in software completely. For contrast, Abstract Data Types serve as a specification and guide to formally verify working software.</blockquote><p>An Abstract Data Type (ADT) is an abstract concept defined by axioms that represent some data and operations on that data. ADTs are <em>not</em> defined in terms of concrete instances and <em>do not specify</em> the concrete data types, structures, or algorithms used in implementations. Instead, ADTs define data types only in terms of their operations, and the axioms to which those operations must adhere.</p><h3>Common ADT Examples</h3><ul><li>List</li><li>Stack</li><li>Queue</li><li>Set</li><li>Map</li><li>Stream</li></ul><p>ADTs can represent any set of operations on any kind of data. In other words, the exhaustive list of all possible ADTs is infinite for the same reason that the exhaustive list of all possible English sentences is infinite. ADTs are the abstract concept of a set of operations over unspecified data, not a specific set of concrete data types. A common misconception is that the specific examples of ADTs taught in many university courses and data structure textbooks are what ADTs are. Many such texts label the data structures “ADTs” and then skip the ADT and describe the data structures in concrete terms instead, without ever exposing the student to an actual abstract representation of the data type. <em>Oops!</em></p><p>ADTs can express many useful algebraic structures, including semigroups, monoids, functors, monads, etc. The <a href=\"https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land\">Fantasyland Specification</a> is a useful catalog of algebraic structures described by ADTs to encourage interoperable implementations in JavaScript. Library builders can verify their implementations using the supplied axioms.</p><h3>Why ADTs?</h3><p>Abstract Data Types are useful because they provide a way for us to formally define reusable modules in a way that is mathematically sound, precise, and unambiguous. This allows us to share a common language to refer to an extensive vocabulary of useful software building blocks: Ideas that are useful to learn and carry with us as we move between domains, frameworks, and even programming languages.</p><h3>History of ADTs</h3><p>In the 1960s and early 1970s, many programmers and computer science researchers were interested in the software crisis. As Edsger Dijkstra put it in his Turing award lecture:</p><blockquote>“The major cause of the software crisis is that the machines have become several orders of magnitude more powerful! To put it quite bluntly: as long as there were no machines, programming was no problem at all; when we had a few weak computers, programming became a mild problem, and now we have gigantic computers, programming has become an equally gigantic problem.”</blockquote><p>The problem he refers to is that software is very complicated. A printed version of the Apollo lunar module and guidance system for NASA is about the height of a filing cabinet. That’s a lot of code. Imagine trying to read and understand every line of that.</p><p>Modern software is orders of magnitude more complicated. Facebook was roughly <a href=\"https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/million-lines-of-code/\">62 million lines of code</a> in 2015. If you printed 50 lines per page, you’d fill 1.24 million pages. If you stacked those pages, you’d get about 1,800 pages per foot, or 688 feet. That’s taller than San Francisco’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Tower_(San_Francisco)\">Millenium Tower</a>, the tallest residential building in San Francisco at the time of this writing.</p><p>Managing software complexity is one of the primary challenges faced by virtually every software developer. In the 1960s and 1970s, they didn’t have the languages, patterns, or tools that we take for granted today. Things like linters, intellisense, and even static analysis tools were not invented yet.</p><p>Many software engineers noted that the hardware they built things on top of mostly worked. But software, more often than not, was complex, tangled, and brittle. Software was commonly:</p><ul><li>Over budget</li><li>Late</li><li>Buggy</li><li>Missing requirements</li><li>Difficult to maintain</li></ul><p>If only you could think about software in modular pieces, you wouldn’t need to understand the whole system to understand how to make part of the system work. That principle of software design is known as locality. To get locality, you need <em>modules</em> that you can understand in isolation from the rest of the system. You should be able to describe a module unambiguously without over-specifying its implementation. That’s the problem that ADTs solve.</p><p>Stretching from the 1960s almost to the present day, advancing the state of software modularity was a core concern. It was with those problems in mind that people including Barbara Liskov (the same Liskov referenced in the Liskov Substitution Principle from the SOLID OO design principles), Alan Kay, Bertrand Meyer and other legends of computer science worked on describing and specifying various tools to enable modular software, including ADTs, object-oriented programming, and design by contract, respectively.</p><p>ADTs emerged from the work of Liskov and her students on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLU_(programming_language)\">the CLU programming language</a> between 1974 and 1975. They contributed significantly to the state of the art of software module specification — the language we use to describe the interfaces that allow software modules to interact. Formally provable interface compliance brings us significantly closer to software modularity and interoperability.</p><p>Liskov was awarded the Turing award for her work on data abstraction, fault tolerance, and distributed computing in 2008. ADTs played a significant role in that accomplishment, and today, virtually every university computer science course includes ADTs in the curriculum.</p><p>The software crisis was never entirely solved, and many of the problems described above should be familiar to any professional developer, but learning how to use tools like objects, modules, and ADTs certainly helps.</p><h3>Specifications for ADTs</h3><p>Several criteria can be used to judge the fitness of an ADT specification. I call these criteria <strong>FAMED</strong>, but I only invented the mnemonic. The original criteria were published by Liskov and Zilles in their famous 1975 paper, <a href=\"http://csg.csail.mit.edu/CSGArchives/memos/Memo-117.pdf\">“Specification Techniques for Data Abstractions.”</a></p><ul><li><strong>Formal.</strong> Specifications must be formal. The meaning of each element in the specification must be defined in enough detail that the target audience should have a reasonably good chance of constructing a compliant implementation from the specification. It must be possible to implement an algebraic proof in code for each axiom in the specification.</li><li><strong>Applicable.</strong> ADTs should be widely applicable. An ADT should be generally reusable for many different concrete use-cases. An ADT which describes a particular implementation in a particular language in a particular part of the code is probably over-specifying things. Instead, ADTs are best suited to describe the behavior of common data structures, library components, modules, programming language features, etc. For example, an ADT describing stack operations, or an ADT describing the behavior of a promise.</li><li><strong>Minimal.</strong> ADT specifications should be minimal. The specification should include the interesting and widely applicable parts of the behavior and nothing more. Each behavior should be described precisely and unambiguously, but in as little specific or concrete detail as possible. Most ADT specifications should be provable using a handful of axioms.</li><li><strong>Extensible.</strong> ADTs should be extensible. A small change in a requirement should lead to only a small change in the specification.</li><li><strong>Declarative.</strong> Declarative specifications describe <em>what,</em> not <em>how.</em> ADTs should be described in terms of what things are, and relationship mappings between inputs and outputs, not the steps to create data structures or the specific steps each operation must carry out.</li></ul><p>A good ADT should include:</p><ul><li><strong>Human readable description.</strong> ADTs can be rather terse if they are not accompanied by some human readable description. The natural language description, combined with the algebraic definitions, can act as checks on each other to clear up any mistakes in the specification or ambiguity in the reader’s understanding of it.</li><li><strong>Definitions.</strong> Clearly define any terms used in the specification to avoid any ambiguity.</li><li><strong>Abstract signatures.</strong> Describe the expected inputs and outputs without linking them to concrete types or data structures.</li><li><strong>Axioms.</strong> Algebraic definitions of the axiom invariants used to prove that an implementation has satisfied the requirements of the specification.</li></ul><h3>Stack ADT Example</h3><p>A stack is a Last In, First Out (LIFO) pile of items which allows users to interact with the stack by pushing a new item to the top of the stack, or popping the most recently pushed item from the top of the stack.</p><p>Stacks are commonly used in parsing, sorting, and data collation algorithms.</p><h3>Definitions</h3><ul><li>a: Any type</li><li>b: Any type</li><li>item: Any type</li><li>stack(): an empty stack</li><li>stack(a): a stack of a</li><li>[item, stack]: a pair of item and stack</li></ul><h3>Abstract Signatures</h3><h4>Construction</h4><p>The stack operation takes any number of items and returns a stack of those items. Typically, the abstract signature for a constructor is defined in terms of itself. Please don’t confuse this with a recursive function.</p><ul><li>stack(...items) =&gt; stack(...items)</li></ul><h4>Stack Operations (operations which return a stack)</h4><ul><li>push(item, stack()) =&gt; stack(item)</li><li>pop(stack) =&gt; [item, stack]</li></ul><h3>Axioms</h3><p>The stack axioms deal primarily with stack and item identity, the sequence of the stack items, and the behavior of pop when the stack is empty.</p><h4>Identity</h4><p>Pushing and popping have no side-effects. If you push to a stack and immediately pop from the same stack, the stack should be in the state it was before you pushed.</p><pre>pop(push(a, stack())) = [a, stack()]</pre><ul><li>Given: push a to the stack and immediately pop from the stack</li><li>Should: return a pair of a and stack().</li></ul><h4>Sequence</h4><p>Popping from the stack should respect the sequence: Last In, First Out (LIFO).</p><pre>pop(push(b, push(a, stack())) = [b, stack(a)]</pre><ul><li>Given: push a to the stack, then push b to the stack, then pop from the stack</li><li>Should: return a pair of b and stack(a).</li></ul><h4>Empty</h4><p>Popping from an empty stack results in an undefined item value. In concrete terms, this could be defined with a Maybe(item), Nothing, or Either. In JavaScript, it’s customary to use undefined. Popping from an empty stack should not change the stack.</p><pre>pop(stack()) = [undefined, stack()]</pre><ul><li>Given: pop from an empty stack</li><li>Should: return a pair of undefined and stack().</li></ul><h3>Concrete Implementations</h3><p>An abstract data type could have many concrete implementations, in different languages, libraries, frameworks, etc. Here is one implementation of the above stack ADT, using an encapsulated object, and pure functions over that object:</p><pre>const stack = (...items) =&gt; ({<br>  push: item =&gt; stack(...items, item),<br>  pop: () =&gt; {<br>    // create a item list<br>    const newItems = [...items];</pre><pre>    // remove the last item from the list and<br>    // assign it to a variable<br>    const [item] = newItems.splice(-1);</pre><pre>    // return the pair<br>    return [item, stack(...newItems)];<br>  },<br>  // So we can compare stacks in our assert function<br>  toString: () =&gt; `stack(${ items.join(&#39;,&#39;) })`<br>});</pre><pre>const push = (item, stack) =&gt; stack.push(item);<br>const pop = stack =&gt; stack.pop();</pre><p>And another that implements the stack operations in terms of pure functions over JavaScript’s existing Array type:</p><pre>const stack = (...elements) =&gt; [...elements];</pre><pre>const push = (a, stack) =&gt; stack.concat([a]);</pre><pre>const pop = stack =&gt; {<br>  const newStack = stack.slice(0);<br>  const item = newStack.pop();<br>  return [item, newStack];<br>};</pre><p>Both versions satisfy the following axiom proofs:</p><pre>// A simple assert function which will display the results<br>// of the axiom tests, or throw a descriptive error if an<br>// implementation fails to satisfy an axiom.<br>const assert = ({given, should, actual, expected}) =&gt; {<br>  const stringify = value =&gt; Array.isArray(value) ?<br>    `[${ value.map(stringify).join(&#39;,&#39;) }]` :<br>    `${ value }`;<br><br>  const actualString = stringify(actual);<br>  const expectedString = stringify(expected);<br><br>  if (actualString === expectedString) {<br>    console.log(`OK:<br>      given: ${ given }<br>      should: ${ should }<br>      actual: ${ actualString }<br>      expected: ${ expectedString }<br>    `);<br>  } else {<br>    throw new Error(`NOT OK:<br>      given ${ given }<br>      should ${ should }<br>      actual: ${ actualString }<br>      expected: ${ expectedString }<br>    `);<br>  }<br>};</pre><pre>// Concrete values to pass to the functions:<br>const a = &#39;a&#39;;<br>const b = &#39;b&#39;;</pre><pre>// Proofs<br>assert({<br>  given: &#39;push `a` to the stack and immediately pop from the stack&#39;,<br>  should: &#39;return a pair of `a` and `stack()`&#39;,<br>  actual: pop(push(a, stack())),<br>  expected: [a, stack()]<br>})</pre><pre>assert({<br>  given: &#39;push `a` to the stack, then push `b` to the stack, then pop from the stack&#39;,<br>  should: &#39;return a pair of `b` and `stack(a)`.&#39;,<br>  actual: pop(push(b, push(a, stack()))),<br>  expected: [b, stack(a)]<br>});</pre><pre>assert({<br>  given: &#39;pop from an empty stack&#39;,<br>  should: &#39;return a pair of undefined, stack()&#39;,<br>  actual: pop(stack()),<br>  expected: [undefined, stack()]<br>});</pre><h3>Conclusion</h3><ul><li><strong>An Abstract Data Type (ADT)</strong> is an abstract concept defined by axioms which represent some data and operations on that data.</li><li><strong>Abstract Data Types are focused on what, not how</strong> (they’re framed declaratively, and do not specify algorithms or data structures).</li><li><strong>Common examples</strong> include lists, stacks, sets, etc.</li><li><strong>ADTs provide a way for us to formally define reusable modules</strong> in a way that is mathematically sound, precise, and unambiguous.</li><li><strong>ADTs emerged from the work of Liskov</strong> and students on the CLU programming language in the 1970s.</li><li><strong>ADTs should be FAMED.</strong> Formal, widely Applicable, Minimal, Extensible, and Declarative.</li><li><strong>ADTs should include</strong> a human readable description, definitions, abstract signatures, and formally verifiable axioms.</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> If you’re not sure whether or not you should encapsulate a function, ask yourself if you would include it in an ADT for your component. Remember, ADTs should be minimal, so if it’s non-essential, lacks cohesion with the other operations, or its specification is likely to change, encapsulate it.</blockquote><h3>Glossary</h3><ul><li><strong>Axioms</strong> are mathematically sound statements which must hold true.</li><li><strong>Mathematically sound</strong> means that each term is well defined mathematically so that it’s possible to write unambiguous and provable statements of fact based on them.</li></ul><h3>Next Steps</h3><p><a href=\"https://ericelliottjs.com/\">EricElliottJS.com</a> features many hours of video lessons and interactive exercises on topics like this.

It’s remote-work friendly, and no matter where you live in the world, if you get good enough, you can qualify for great paying work ranging from <a href=\"https://medium.com/javascript-scene/what-to-pay-javascript-developers-in-2020-2292eb346f3b\">$100k/year — $200k+/year (USD)</a>. Some of the highest-paid JavaScript developers make close to $500k/year. But to qualify for those great salaries, you have to get undeniably good at what you do.</p><p>Even if you’re already a professional software developer, you need to learn how to learn to code. Choosing a career in software development is choosing a path of lifelong learning.</p><p>In my role as a mentor I’ve had a peek into the learning process of hundreds of developers. What shocked me most is how much faster some learn than others. Some with little or no coding background learn new concepts more than 10 times faster than others who may have 10+ year’s experience in the craft. The secret is, you can, too.</p><p>There are a handful of learning secrets that can put you on a rocket to mastery of the craft.</p><h4>1. Code</h4><p>The best way to learn to code is to code. Jump into a <a href=\"https://codesandbox.io\">development</a> <a href=\"https://babeljs.io/repl\">environment</a>, and write some code. If you’re reading a book or blog post and you encounter a code example, type it out in a <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">code</a> <a href=\"https://quokkajs.com/\">editor</a> and try to make it work. Once you get it working, play with it. Change things up. Try to think of other ways to apply it, or other things you can do with the same technique. <a href=\"https://studio.code.org/s/starwars/stage/1/puzzle/1\"><em>Play</em></a><em> </em><a href=\"http://www.flexboxdefense.com/\"><em>with</em></a><em> </em><a href=\"https://codepip.com/\"><em>the</em></a><em> </em><a href=\"https://screeps.com/\"><em>code</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Book smarts will only get you so far. The best <em>learning</em> will come from <em>doing.</em></p><h4>2. Drive</h4><p>The best way to get great at something is to do it. A lot. You need to be motivated and determined to learn. One way to get motivated is to give yourself the time and patience to gain some mastery. You don’t need to be an expert right away. It’s like learning a musical instrument. You can’t sit down at a piano and immediately be the next Debussy, but you can master the C major scale in your first sitting.</p><p>Likewise, you’re not going to sit down and immediately crank out the next Instagram, TikTok or Fortnite.</p><p>As you begin to master each small lesson, you’ll realize you can do this. You can get good at this. You can start to see your goal begin to materialize, and you’ll be more motivated to drive toward that goal.</p><p>Keep at it.</p><h4>3. Focus</h4><p>I’ve seen a lot of developers try to master everything all at once and get nowhere, fast. Their progress slows to an excruciatingly glacial crawl rather than a gold medal sprint.</p><p>If you want to learn something quickly, you can’t have your attention scattered everywhere except where you need it. Pick <em>one language</em> (<a href=\"https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2020/02/28/language-rankings-1-20/\">start with JavaScript</a>), <em>one framework</em> (<a href=\"https://medium.com/javascript-scene/top-javascript-frameworks-and-topics-to-learn-in-2020-and-the-new-decade-ced6e9d812f9\">start with React</a>), <em>one book, one course, one topic, </em>etc. Whatever you pick, focus on that one thing until you have a sufficient mastery of it <em>before</em> you move on to something else.</p><p>I tell people all the time, concentrate on one language full time for at least a year before you branch out and learn another language. Decades ago, it used to be that a typical software developer would actually need to learn many languages in the course of their career to stay competitive in the field.</p><p>While it’s still true that learning more than one language can teach you different ways of seeing things, and even deepen your understanding of your primary language, these days a single language (JavaScript) can get you through the majority of your career.</p><p><strong><em>Tip from a hiring manager:</em></strong><em> The skills you specialize in are your most valuable skills. If you commit to being a lifelong generalist bouncing from language to language, you’ll put an artificial ceiling on your mastery and earning potential.</em></p><h4>4. Read</h4><p>Many of the most useful insights available to software developers come from books. There are lots of good YouTube videos and courses online, but books are the standard bearers of software development culture and knowledge. In particular, I’ve found the following books extremely valuable:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3eOI5b2\">Eloquent JavaScript</a></li><li><a href=\"https://leanpub.com/composingsoftware\">Composing Software</a> (Disclaimer: I wrote this one. <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3eOwgSa\">The printed version is available on Amazon</a>.)</li><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3cGu0e4\">Code Complete: 2nd Edition</a></li><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/351eAye\">Clean Code: A Handbook for Agile Software Craftsmanship</a></li><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3avUZrm\">Test Driven Development By Example</a></li><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2VV0bzA\">Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code 2nd Edition</a></li></ul><h4>5. Review</h4><p>If you want to move a new concept from a familiar-sounding idea into long-term memory, reviewing a topic is your friend. The mistake most learners make is that they quickly read a book or a blog post, and then promptly forget what they read the next day. If you read something interesting that you want to remember, review it the next day. Test yourself. Then test yourself again the day after. And the day after. Do that 4 days in a row, and your chances of committing the learning to long-term memory <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5126970/\">increase dramatically</a>.</p><h4>6. Mix Mediums</h4><p>Some people learn best by reading, others by watching videos, but if you mix it up — watch a video, then do some reading, then practice with some interactive code sessions, you’ll repeat the concepts from multiple angles, and multiple examples. You’ll naturally drill some review, and get some practice in while you’re at it.</p><h4>7. Build Projects</h4><p>Learning the concept doesn’t mean you’ll know how to use it in a real app. Once you’ve been coding with exercises for a few weeks, it’ll be time to build something of your own. Need an idea? Instead of the ubiquitous todo app, try implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/learn-javascript-courses/rejection/\">The Rejection App</a>.</p><h4>8. Value Principles Over Frameworks and Languages</h4><p>Frameworks and APIs change fast. Software design principles are evergreen. Learn principles that translate across language barriers.</p><p>Examples:</p><ul><li>“A small change in requirements should lead to only a small change in implementation.” (Paraphrased from <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3529Ybk\">“A Practical Handbook for Software Development”</a>)</li><li>Do One Thing (DOT) — Simplified from Doug McIlroy’s “Do One Thing and Do It Well (DOTADIW)” — a function should have one job. It should not fetch data AND process data AND draw to the screen. It should only fetch data. Or only process data. Or only draw to the screen. (Time to split your React components into smaller parts!)</li><li>“Program to an interface, not an implementation.” — Gang of Four, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2XXwiRX\">“Design Patterns”</a></li><li>“Favor object composition over class inheritance.” — Gang of Four, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2XXwiRX\">“Design Patterns”</a></li><li>Avoid shared mutable state.</li><li>“Premature optimization is the root of all evil.” ~ Donald Knuth</li><li>“You Aren’t Gonna Need It (YAGNI)” — Don’t write code for something that isn’t actually required, yet.</li></ul><h4>9. Share, Document, and Mentor</h4><blockquote>“Dr. Hoenikker used to say that any scientist who couldn’t explain to an eight-year-old what he was doing was a charlatan.” ~ Kurt Vonnegut — <a href=\"https://amzn.to/351cAGh\">Cat’s Cradle</a></blockquote><p>Learning how to code is just part of the equation. When you’re collaborating with other developers, your code will be reviewed by other people, and they will sometimes challenge your choices. As you try to explain yourself, you may find that you didn’t understand well enough to defend your position. Practice explaining, documenting, and teaching the concepts to your coworkers and other collaborators on your projects.</p><h4>10. Practice, practice, practice!</h4><p>Anybody who’s ever learned an acquired skill can attest, practice is key. But to get better you can’t just practice the concepts you already know. You need to challenge yourself and extend beyond the realm of what is familiar. If you constantly practice at the edge of your current abilities, you will excel.</p><p>The book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3bCBqio\">“Peak: The New Science of Expertise”</a> delves into the study of deliberate practice and offers a wealth of insights that you can apply in your daily life to get better at practice.

Don’t just drop an await in everywhere you use promises. Instead, think about the fetching dependencies. If you’re fetching more than one thing, make sure you fetch in parallel whenever you can. This will make a huge difference in your application’s performance.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FlpDwfwhFuPQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DlpDwfwhFuPQ&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FlpDwfwhFuPQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/4bc5f8f6048d6f3027761a3514422260/href\">https://medium.com/media/4bc5f8f6048d6f3027761a3514422260/href</a></iframe><p>Here’s some example code for you to play with.</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/066741c6dc8afdf2a9d878e4fcfd1958/href\">https://medium.com/media/066741c6dc8afdf2a9d878e4fcfd1958/href</a></iframe><p><strong><em>Eric Elliott</em></strong><em> is a tech product and platform advisor, author of </em><a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fleanpub.com%2Fcomposingsoftware\"><em>“Composing Software”</em></a><em>, cofounder of </em><a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=http%3A%2F%2FEricElliottJS.com\"><em>EricElliottJS.com</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=http%3A%2F%2FDevAnywhere.io\"><em>DevAnywhere.io</em></a><em>, and dev team mentor.

I’m posting the introduction again for those of us who are too lazy to click a link.</blockquote><p>Managing user authentication and authorization is a very serious responsibility, and getting it wrong can cost a lot more than unauthorized access to your app. It can also compromise user privacy or lead to financial damage or identity theft for your users. Unless you are a huge company with a huge security team, you don’t want that kind of responsibility or liability for your app.</p><p>Most apps today are built with username and password authentication, and once a user is signed in, that user session can do anything it wants to do, without revalidating the user’s intention.</p><p>That security model is broken for a number of reasons:</p><p><strong>Passwords are obsolete.</strong> If you have any doubt about that, head over to <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/\">HaveIBeenPwned</a> and plunk in your email address. Sensitive data has been stolen in many high profile data breaches impacting companies like Dropbox, Adobe, Disqus, Kickstarter, LinkedIn, Tumblr, and many, many more. If there’s a database with passwords in it, it’s only a matter of time before it gets stolen.</p><p><strong>Hashing passwords won’t save you or your users.</strong> Once a database of passwords has been stolen, hackers aim immense distributed computing power at those password databases. They use parallel GPUs or giant <a href=\"https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/massive-botnet-attack-used-more-than-400000-iot-devices-a-12841\">botnets with hundreds of thousands of nodes</a> to try <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/25-gpus-devour-password-hashes-at-up-to-348-billion-per-second/\">hundreds of billions of password combinations per second</a> in hopes of recovering plaintext username/password pairs.</p><p>If an attacker can discover a password that hashes to the same hash as the one stored in your database, they’ll take that combination and try it on things like bank account websites. In many cases, even a salted, hashed password database will leak another valid username/password pair every minute or so. That’s about half a million leaked passwords per year — and that rate is doubling every few years. I wrote about this topic in 2013. The bad guys are now hashing passwords more than 10 times faster than they were then.</p><p><strong>User Sessions Get Hijacked.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_hijacking_attack\">User sessions are commonly hijacked</a> after authentication, allowing attackers to exploit that user’s application resources. To prevent that, you’d need to re-authenticate the user with every request, and in the land of usernames and passwords, that would create an awkward user experience.</p><h4>Upgrading Authentication</h4><p>One of the coolest features of decentralized applications is the decentralized security model. Using the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem, each user gets a public and private key pair. You can sign every request with the user’s private key and verify requests with the user’s public key. Each request is uniquely authenticated, which reduces the chance of hijacking to nearly zero.</p><p>A hijacker would need the ability to sign on behalf of the user, but they can’t do that without access to the user’s private key, which is protected by hardware-level security. Using <strong>Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)</strong>, we can protect private keys from exposure to the internet. Instead of sending the private key over the network, we send the messages which need signing to the private key in the HSM. The user authorizes the signature, and the signed request gets authenticated and processed. If the signature is invalid, the request gets rejected.</p><p>Additionally, those key pairs can encrypt and decrypt user data so that only the user who owns the data can read it. If an app developer chooses to let users encrypt their data, even the application can’t decrypt the data without the user’s permission. With this security model, we can put users in control of their private information.</p><h3>Passwordless Authentication with Magic Links</h3><p>An emerging way to bypass the need for passwords is to use magic links. A magic link is a temporary URL that expires after use, or after a specific interval of time. Magic links can be sent to your email address, an app, or a security device. Clicking the link authorizes you to sign in.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F402367350%3Fapp_id%3D122963&amp;dntp=1&amp;display_name=Vimeo&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F402367350&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F871440741_960.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo\" width=\"1174\" height=\"720\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/86327d0ba6095185e4b0be503e470da1/href\">https://medium.com/media/86327d0ba6095185e4b0be503e470da1/href</a></iframe><p>Password-only security is obsolete and dangerously insecure. Magic links eliminate the headaches of lost or stolen passwords and protect app users.</p><p>But you don’t want to try to roll your own public/private key-based magic links, or you’ll move from the frying pan into the fire. If you think keeping passwords safe is hard, don’t even think of trying to manage private keys, which, if stolen, could potentially grant access to an Ethereum wallet loaded with valuable money, collectibles, memberships, etc.</p><p>Lots of apps and wallets push that responsibility on end users. That’s like putting the key to a bank vault in somebody’s mobile phone. What if the phone gets lost, stolen, or upgraded?</p><p>In my opinion, the best way forward is to delegate key management to people who specialize in key management. One such service has launched today. It’s called <a href=\"https://magic.link/\">Magic</a>. It’s made by Magic Labs, a cybersecurity company who have assembled experts from companies like Docker, Apple, Google, Amazon, Yelp, Uber, Accenture, and TD Bank.</p><p>Their security model stores your user’s private keys in HSMs. An HSM is a bit like a hardware locker for private keys. The keys are protected by hardware and never leave the hardware. Keys are never exposed to the internet. Instead, messages that need to be signed by those keys are delivered to and signed on the dedicated hardware.</p><p>Imagine a bank safety deposit box. What’s inside the box is a key that can be used to authorize signatures and transactions. When you rent a safety deposit box from a bank, the contents of the box belong to you. The bank just keeps it safe for you. Using Magic is a bit like giving each of your users a dedicated safety deposit box for their key. Magic can’t access the keys, and neither can you. Keys are always in the user’s control but hosted in the cloud, so users don’t have to worry about losing them.</p><p>In other words, Magic is a non-custodial, hardware-secured key management system. It features best-in-class security and SOC 2 compliance. But the best part is that your users don’t need to know what any of that means. All they need to know how to do is enter their email and click a button.</p><h4>Adding Magic to Your App</h4><p><a href=\"https://docs.magic.link/\">Magic has a great getting started guide</a> and documentation to help you get set up fast and understand the basics, but we’re going to take a deeper dive and dissect the actual useMagicLink React hook that we developed for our integration with <a href=\"https://ericelliottjs.com/\">EricElliottJS.com</a>. If you read the previous article on Fortmatic, this is going to look very similar to the useFortmatic hook we developed before, but it has a few slight changes.</p><p>Before you dive into the source code, you’ll need to understand some foundational concepts:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html\">React basics</a></li><li><a href=\"https://medium.com/javascript-scene/a-functional-programmers-introduction-to-javascript-composing-software-d670d14ede30\">JavaScript arrow functions and basic syntax</a></li><li><a href=\"https://medium.com/javascript-scene/curry-and-function-composition-2c208d774983\">Curried functions</a></li><li><a href=\"https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-promise-27fc71e77261\">Promises</a></li><li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html\">React hooks</a></li><li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html\">useEffect</a>, <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html\">useState</a>, and <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useref\">useRef</a></li><li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage\">localStorage</a></li><li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html\">Higher Order Components (HOCs)</a></li></ul><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/1f54f2fa1089b1c9f007371654c65a33/href\">https://medium.com/media/1f54f2fa1089b1c9f007371654c65a33/href</a></iframe><p>This file requires a few helpers.

This <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html\">Higher Order Component (HOC)</a> lets us compose our magic link logic into every page in our app in one place.</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/c22c0c96377ea729dbb38ff76451e477/href\">https://medium.com/media/c22c0c96377ea729dbb38ff76451e477/href</a></iframe><p>Here’s the HOC we use to compose cross-cutting concerns into every page that needs them:</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/2147bac35f72a861ac8614a494bb5778/href\">https://medium.com/media/2147bac35f72a861ac8614a494bb5778/href</a></iframe><p>Since these HOCs are so easy to create and maintain, you can create custom HOCs that omit features that aren’t needed for a particular page or add features that aren’t needed for every page. Now we can sign in or out anywhere on our site!</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>Here are my current recommendations for user authentication security:</p><ul><li><strong>Password-only security is obsolete and dangerously insecure.</strong> Don’t use it.</li><li><strong>Public key cryptography gives us public/private key pairs</strong> we can use to enhance user safety significantly.</li><li><strong>Key management is hard,</strong> both for app developers and end users.</li><li><strong>App developers should delegate key management</strong> to security specialists.</li><li><strong>Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) can securely store user keys in the cloud,</strong> without forcing users to know what any of this means.</li><li><strong>Magic links eliminate the headaches of lost or stolen passwords</strong> and protect app users.</li><li><strong>Magic provides best-in-class, non-custodial, delegated key management</strong> for your users. They’re paving the way for a more secure future for apps and users. They have set a new bar for user authentication security and user experience, and they’re currently the only authentication solution I recommend for developers of new applications.</li><li><strong>Magic unlocks Ethereum.</strong> With Magic’s Ethereum-based public/private key pairs, we can use them to transact with Ethereum and EVM-compatible protocols and tokens, unlocking lots of capabilities that were never possible before blockchain technology was invented.</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>You don’t have to build an Ethereum dapp to benefit from Magic’s passwordless authentication and improved user security. You can improve <strong>any app</strong> with Magic.</blockquote><h4>Next Steps</h4><p><a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/magic-11\">Magic is launching on Product Hunt</a> right now. Pop over and comment, ask questions, and engage with the makers.</p><p>Take a test drive of the authentication flow on <a href=\"https://ericelliottjs.com/account\">EricElliottJS.com</a>. Our existing users have GitHub authenticated accounts that need to be linked the first time you sign in, but once you’ve linked your GitHub account once, you won’t need to do it again. Sign out and sign back in to see the Magic-only flow.</p><p>The GitHub flow requires shields to be down in Brave because of how the authentication flow is delegated. The new Magic authentication flow works like a charm with shields up. Magic’s simplified flow has lots of hidden benefits.</p><p>While you’re checking out EricElliottJS.com, browse the <a href=\"https://ericelliottjs.com/premium-content\">premium content</a>, and explore some of our online JavaScript lessons.</p><p>Make some magic.</p><p><strong><em>Eric Elliott</em></strong><em> is a tech product and platform advisor, author of </em><a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fleanpub.com%2Fcomposingsoftware\"><em>“Composing Software”</em></a><em>, cofounder of </em><a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=http%3A%2F%2FEricElliottJS.com\"><em>EricElliottJS.com</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=http%3A%2F%2FDevAnywhere.io\"><em>DevAnywhere.io</em></a><em>, and dev team mentor.

The difference was that the study instructions included two checklists — When to wash hands:</p><ul><li>Before preparing food or feeding it to others</li><li>After sneezing our coughing</li><li>After wiping an infant</li><li>After using a bathroom</li></ul><p>Most people were already washing their hands after using a bathroom, but they weren’t doing it properly. The checklist also included instructions:</p><ul><li>Use soap.</li><li>Wet both hands completely.</li><li>Rub the soap until it forms a thick lather covering both hands completely.</li><li>Wash hands for at least 20 seconds [not included in this study, but we know now it takes at least 20 seconds to break down viral bugs including Coronavirus so I’m putting it here for posterity].</li><li>Completely rinse the soap off.</li></ul><p>It was not the particular soap used — any soap is effective. It was the checklists that prevented illness. The checklists changed behaviors and taught people how and when to properly wash their hands.</p><p>If you talk to members of my teams, you’ll discover that we create checklists for lots of things. The best checklists are:</p><ul><li>[ ] Short enough to memorize</li><li>[ ] Only include the key points</li></ul><p>If they get too long, conformance to the checklist drops, as people begin to see checklist points as optional suggestions.</p><p>Here are some real examples of the checklists we commonly use on our teams. A few of these (like FIRST and RAIL) are widely used and developed externally. Several others (including 5 Questions, RITE Way, Test Timing, and both CI/CD lists) were developed by me, but inspired by common industry best practices:</p><h4>Code Review Checklist</h4><p>Before merging a pull request, check that the following have been considered:</p><ul><li>[ ] PR is small enough (otherwise, break it up)</li><li>[ ] Code is readable</li><li>[ ] Code is tested</li><li>[ ] The features are documented</li><li>[ ] Files are located and named correctly</li><li>[ ] Error states are properly handled</li><li>[ ] Bonus: Screenshots/screencast demo included</li></ul><h4>Code Test Checklist (RITE Way)</h4><p>In quality software, developers must deliver tests which automatically prove that the code works. To test the RITE Way, each test should be:</p><ul><li>[ ] Readable</li><li>[ ] Isolated (units and tests)/Integrated (for integration tests)</li><li>[ ] Thorough</li><li>[ ] Explicit</li></ul><h4>Test Timing Checklist</h4><ul><li>[ ] Unit tests run in under 10 seconds</li><li>[ ] Functional tests should run in under 10 minutes</li><li>[ ] CI/CD checks should run in under 10 minutes</li></ul><h4>5 Questions Every Unit Test Should Answer</h4><ul><li>[ ] What is the component under test?</li><li>[ ] What is its expected behavior (in human readable form)?</li><li>[ ] What is its actual output?</li><li>[ ] What is its expected output?</li><li>[ ] How do you reproduce a test failure? (Double check that the answers to the above answer this question).</li></ul><p>Which is unsurprisingly similar to the bug report checklist, because all failing unit tests should be good bug reports.</p><h4>Bug Report Checklist</h4><p>Each bug report should include:</p><ul><li>[ ] Description (including location)</li><li>[ ] Expected output</li><li>[ ] Actual output</li><li>[ ] Instructions to reproduce</li><li>[ ] Environment (browser/OS versions, extensions)</li><li>[ ] Bonus: Screenshot/screencast demonstrating the bug</li></ul><h4>Component Checklist (FIRST)</h4><p>Components should follow the FIRST principles:</p><ul><li>[ ] Focused</li><li>[ ] Independent</li><li>[ ] Reusable</li><li>[ ] Small</li><li>[ ] Testable</li></ul><h4>Software User Interface (UI) Performance Checklist (RAIL)</h4><p>Software UIs should conform to the RAIL performance model:</p><ul><li>[ ] Respond to user interaction in under 100ms</li><li>[ ] Animation frames should draw in under 10ms</li><li>[ ] Idle time processes should be batched in blocks of less than 50ms</li><li>[ ] Load in under 1 second</li></ul><h4>Continuous Delivery Preparedness Checklist</h4><ul><li>[ ] A minimum of 80% of the code is covered by unit tests.</li><li>[ ] All critical user workflows are covered by functional tests.</li><li>[ ] All critical integrations are covered by integration tests.</li><li>[ ] A feature toggle system exists to toggle features on and off in the production environment. All unfinished features are toggled off by default.</li></ul><h4>CI/CD Checklist</h4><ul><li>[ ] Each commit to master must first pass through a Pull Request (PR) process. Merging must be blocked until checks pass.</li><li>[ ] Each pull request must be peer reviewed before merging into the master branch.</li><li>[ ] Each pull request must pass a full suite of automated tests configured to stop the integration process if any tests fail.</li><li>[ ] Each commit triggers its own sandboxed build for testing, demonstration and verification. The build link is added to the code review data.</li><li>[ ] After all checks pass, merging is unblocked.</li><li>[ ] The author of the pull request must OK the merge (or be personally responsible for merge).</li><li>[ ] Merging should trigger automatic production deployment of the newly integrated code. Hence, the master branch should always reflect the production product build.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Eric Elliott</em></strong><em> is the author of the books, </em><a href=\"https://leanpub.com/composingsoftware\"><em>“Composing Software”</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"http://pjabook.com/\"><em>“Programming JavaScript Applications”</em></a><em>.

You’ll be confronted with dozens of purchasing decisions, and you may feel like you need to do a lot of research. I build and advise remote development teams as part of my regular work, and have been doing so since 2014. I’ve looked at all the microphones and headsets, furniture, and accessories, so you can gear up quickly and get right to work.</p><p>Here are my current recommendations.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Purchase using these links to support more great, free content.</blockquote><p><strong>A Fast Computer</strong></p><p>Remote software development is CPU and memory intensive. You’ll often be recording and transcoding video clips, screen sharing or video chatting while compiling and interacting with a web browser.</p><p>Lots of computers will struggle with those demands. You’ll start an npm install and the video will drop frames. Grab at least 16 GB of RAM for best results. 32 GB is better. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-Storage-2-3GHz/dp/B081FV1Y57/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=eejs-20&amp;linkId=737ce037467f9a765952d453975cd658&amp;language=en_US\">A current MacBook Pro</a> will do a great job.</p><p>I recently purchased the 16&quot; 8-core i9. It’s a great machine. It’s lighter, smaller, and still manages to pack an extra inch of screen real-estate into the compact package. I love the new keyboard, touch bar, and touch ID, and I don’t miss the old function keys. Apple recently announced the new M1 laptops.</p><p>New MacBooks only have USB-C compatible Thunderbolt 3 ports. You’ll probably need to connect to USB 3, HDMI, and memory cards. You can get <a href=\"https://amzn.to/33j48l7\">a connector hub</a> that has all of those built-in.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-Storage-2-3GHz/dp/B081FV1Y57/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=eejs-20&amp;linkId=737ce037467f9a765952d453975cd658&amp;language=en_US\">Apple MacBook Pro 16&quot;, 8 Core i9, 16GB RAM, 1TB Storage, Space Gray</a></li><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Wbzngm\">Lenton USB-C Hub w/HDMI, USB 3, Card Readers</a></li></ul><h4>External Keyboard, Trackpad, Mouse</h4><p>Ideally, you’ll want to mount your laptop on a high stand to bring your screen and video camera up to eye level. Doing so will make you more comfortable, allow you to easily adjust your camera for video conferencing, and probably improve your health, but it will also put the built-in keyboard and trackpad out of easy reach.</p><p>In my opinion, nothing beats the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3aZmNoI\">Apple Magic Keyboard</a> and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TQjYAy\">Apple Magic Trackpad</a> for productivity. Syncing is easy. There are no battery replacements to worry about. Plug them in with the included cable, and you can charge them while you work.</p><p>If you plan to do any gaming to relax when you’re not working, you’ll want a real mouse. Trackpads just won’t do it. The best mice out there are designed for gamers. Check out the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2INs4nh\">Logitech G Pro Wireless</a>.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2INamzY\">Apple Magic Keyboard with Number Keys</a></li><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3b0mWb8\">Apple Magic Trackpad</a></li><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2INs4nh\">Logitech G Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse</a></li></ul><h4>A Good Microphone</h4><p>A built-in mic is OK, but it’s not ideal for video chats. First, it’s too close to the speakers, so if the speakers are too loud, it will pick up your coworker’s voices and echo back to them, which can be very distracting. Second, it’s not very good at rejecting sound that’s farther away, so it’ll pick up all the background noise.</p><p>If you want your coworkers to really hear you clearly, pick up a better external mic. Choose a dynamic mic rather than a condenser mic. You need to speak directly into a dynamic mic for it to pick up the sound well. That’s a good thing, because it automatically filters out most of the background noise.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F398095917%3Fapp_id%3D122963&amp;dntp=1&amp;display_name=Vimeo&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F398095917&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F865589009_960.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo\" width=\"1150\" height=\"720\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/3d66cf1454aac4802620aa644600c104/href\">https://medium.com/media/3d66cf1454aac4802620aa644600c104/href</a></iframe><p>I’ve tried a whole lot of mics over the years, and I keep circling back to the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/33obTWY\">Shure Beta 58A</a>. This is a professional mic commonly used by professional musicians on stage, which means it’s not a USB mic. That’s OK.</p><p>You’ll need a USB audio interface. My favorite is the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2wXKezH\">Scarlet 2i2</a>. While you’re at it, pick up an adjustable boom stand for the mic. There are <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2vWkJ1X\">good ones that clamp to your desk</a>.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/33lvuXD\">Shure Beta 58A Microphone</a></li><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/33k0vv6\">Focusrite Scarlet 2i2 USB Audio Interface</a></li><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2WfgRDL\">Boom Arm Desk Mount Mic Stand</a></li></ul><h4>A Good Monitor</h4><p>The MacBook Pro monitor is great, but even a 16&quot; monitor is a bit small. While I’m coding, I usually have a browser and terminal on one screen, and an IDE on the other. Having plenty of screen real-estate can help you be up to 20% more productive. It’s worth splurging on <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2w98YVP\">a nice ultra wide</a>. While you’re at it, pick up a desk mountable, adjustable stand. My favorite is the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2IHvNm6\">VARIDESK Vari Monitor arm + Laptop Stand</a>.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2w98YVP\">LG 34WN80C-B 34 inch 21:9 Curved UltraWide WQHD IPS Monitor</a></li><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2IHvNm6\">VARIDESK VARI Monitor Arm + Laptop Stand</a></li></ul><h4>Headphones</h4><p>If your surroundings are loud, first, remember your coworkers and mute yourself when you’re not talking. Second, you may want to block out the noise for yourself. A pair of comfortable, over-ear, closed-back headphones might come in handy. It’s hard to do better than the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2xCvIxS\">Beyerdynamic DT 1770 Pro</a>.</p><p>If you are in a particularly noisy environment you may want to get some cans with active noise canceling. Many of those also offer wireless connectivity. The <a href=\"https://amzn.to/39Uef2a\">Sennheiser Momentum 3</a> offers best-in-class sound and a more natural sound signature helps you avoid ear fatigue. It also offers a transparent mode so you can have conversations or hear your surroundings without taking them off.</p><p>Sometimes you might want to tune into a meeting without looking like you’re hiding in some gigantic over-ear headphones. Sennheiser has you covered with the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/39SiyuJ\">Momentum True Wireless Earbuds</a>. I find these far more comfortable than the ubiquitous Apple AirPods. Despite their popularity, AirPods don’t comfortably fit all ears, don’t offer different size or ear shape options, and can’t hold a candle to Sennheiser on comfort or sound quality.</p><p>If you don’t need the noise isolation, the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/38Sy5JM\">AKG K 701</a> will let your ears breathe and offer more transparent, detailed, expansive sound than any of the other options here. If you’re looking for the best sound quality to enjoy some great sounding music while you work, with great comfort and build quality, these are the ones to buy.</p><p>Sick of headphones? Check out the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/33riFer\">Beats Pill+ bluetooth speaker</a>. It’s hard to believe such great sound can come out of such a small package. Compact, loud, and plenty of punch.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2IQNO1i\">Beyerdynamic DT 1770 Pro Closed Ear Headphones</a></li><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/38TkCBw\">Sennheiser Momentum 3 Noise Cancelling Wireless Headphones</a></li><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/39SiyuJ\">Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless Earbuds</a></li><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2w9qOYM\">AKG K 701 Open Ear Headphones</a></li><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/33riFer\">Beats Pill+ Bluetooth Speaker</a></li></ul><h4>Lights</h4><p>For best results, you don’t want a big window with bright sunlight directly behind you. Your indoor lighting won’t be able to compete with the sun, and your face will be lost in shadow on your video calls. Instead, you want good illumination. I used to use a pair of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2voUkcK\">brightness and color adjustable LED panel desk lamps</a> which I set up on the left and right sides of my desk. Now I use <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dazzne-Photography-3000K-8000K-Conference-Streaming/dp/B089K24NVF/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=eejs-20&amp;linkId=4c3a365d63fc7862e64ef09aaefb258f&amp;language=en_US\">desk mountable LED panels</a> to free up desk space.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F398067505%3Fapp_id%3D122963&amp;dntp=1&amp;display_name=Vimeo&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F398067505&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F865549487_960.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo\" width=\"1150\" height=\"720\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/e37bfefa375ea835ec909fac839c3917/href\">https://medium.com/media/e37bfefa375ea835ec909fac839c3917/href</a></iframe><p>The panels are bigger, which makes it possible to position them a little further away and retain the softness. They also get brighter than the lamps, so they can more easily compete with and overpower a bright background, like a window.</p><p>Many people make the mistake of skipping the lights. Don’t make that mistake. Good lighting is an inexpensive way to dramatically improve the experience of video calls. Even an inexpensive lamp can make a dramatic difference.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2INtoGB\">LED Panel Desk Lamps</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dazzne-Photography-3000K-8000K-Conference-Streaming/dp/B089K24NVF/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=eejs-20&amp;linkId=4c3a365d63fc7862e64ef09aaefb258f&amp;language=en_US\">Dazzne D50 Desk Mountable LED Panels</a></li></ul><h4>A Good Chair</h4><p>You’re going to spend a lot of time sitting. You need a good chair. My favorite is the <a href=\"https://store.hermanmiller.com/office/office-chairs/aeron-chair/2195348.html?lang=en_US\">Herman Miller Aeron chair</a>. I would say it’s the Rolls-Royce of office chairs, but it’s not about luxury. It’s about posture, comfort, and health. A cheap chair could lead to far more expensive back trouble. Besides, it looks a lot more professional than <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2xCKjJI\">a gaming chair</a>.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://store.hermanmiller.com/office/office-chairs/aeron-chair/2195348.html?lang=en_US\">Herman Miller Aeron Chair</a></li><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/39U5rcG\">GT Omega Pro Gaming Chair</a> (Really, pick the Herman Miller chair)</li></ul><h4>A Good Desk</h4><p>You’ll want a desk with space for a dual monitor. Bonus: The ability to sit or stand.

Let’s finish now by considering a pair of tightly related methods: find() and findIndex() that also need a workaround.</p><blockquote>Why do these methods fail? The reason is the same as for <em>some()</em> and <em>every()</em>, which we studied in <a href=\"https://medium.com/dailyjs/async-loops-and-why-they-fail-part-3-4cf6f8452e33\">Part 3 of this series</a>. If we provide them an async function, a promise is returned every time, and promises being “truthy” objects, searches seem to always be successful!</blockquote><h3>Implementing find()</h3><p>Let’s remember how array.find() works: basically, it loops through the whole array, looking for a value that satisfies a given function, and when found, looping stops and the value is produced as a result; if the loop gets to the end of the array without success, undefined is returned instead. And yes, this is a bit of a problem is you were looking for an undefined value yourself; how would you know if the search succeeded or not? Using findIndex() would solve that, though.</p><blockquote>As in all the previous articles in this series, we’ll always code functions in two ways: as a method to be added to the Array.prototype (even if doing this is usually frowned upon…) and as a common function — you may use any of those.</blockquote><p>Our search will have to work with two values: a found boolean attribute that will be true if the search succeeded, and a value attribute that will store the value that satisfied the function. We’ll initialize found to false, and value to undefined; if the search succeeds, we’ll change found to true, and also update value.</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/d1f5643df96ecc416c1317d92636f64c/href\">https://medium.com/media/d1f5643df96ecc416c1317d92636f64c/href</a></iframe><p>Logic is a bit harder — we pass around an object with the found and value attributes, and at the end, we pick out just the latter attribute.</p><p>To test this, we could again use our sample array (with values 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8) and see if we can find some value whose square equals 9 — and we’ll also have the async call if provided with 2 as its argument, as in previous examples. Code could be as follows.</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/1a3d7c16036ea6d5c1a4224c31e3257b/href\">https://medium.com/media/1a3d7c16036ea6d5c1a4224c31e3257b/href</a></iframe><p>If we run this, we get something like the following for both versions of the code.</p><pre>16:20:37.135 START -- using .findAsync(...) method <br>16:20:37.139 Calling - v=1 i=0 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>16:20:38.141 Success - false <br>16:20:38.142 Calling - v=2 i=1 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>16:20:40.143 Failure - error <br>16:20:40.143 Calling - v=3 i=2 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>16:20:43.146 Success - true <br><strong>16:20:43.146 END -- 3</strong></pre><p>The failure was ignored, and only three async calls were made; after finding that 3 squared equals 9, we got our final result.

In this article we’ll continue our study of possible fixes, by finding alternative implementations for some() and every().</p><blockquote>When looking at <em>some()</em> and <em>every()</em> I thought they would probably fail (because many other functions also did fail!) just because they weren’t promise-ready, but the reason here was simpler: if we pass an async function to them, a promise is returned every time — and since promises are “truthy” objects, all values were understood to pass the test, no matter what the async call returned!</blockquote><p>It should be said that at first I thought implementing these functions would be trivial: to check if some element of the array fulfills a condition, why not use mapAsync() first (our async-aware version of map()) and then apply some() to its output? (Of course, if I wanted to check if every element fulfilled a condition, after mapAsync() I would have used every().) Fortunately, I didn’t go that way , because some() is supposed to stop looping as soon as it finds a value that fulfills the condition (and every() stops when it finds an element that <em>doesn’t</em> fulfill the condition) so a single async call could be enough in some cases, while my plan would <em>always</em> involve calls for <em>all</em> elements; not efficient at all!</p><h3>Implementing some()</h3><p>Given our experience with looping and reducing (see part 1 of this series) implementing someAsync() was not hard.</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/9d5afadcaeea7a3f12ed2229097efb35/href\">https://medium.com/media/9d5afadcaeea7a3f12ed2229097efb35/href</a></iframe><p>We loop through the array, and the important thing is stopping doing async calls as soon as we know for sure that some elements fulfills the given predicate — a simple thing to achieve by using the|| operator. If an async call fails, we just keep passing the initial false value.</p><blockquote>As in the two previous articles, we’ll always be coding functions in two ways: as a method added to the Array.prototype (even if this practice is not usually recommended…) and also as a single, stand-alone function; pick whichever you prefer.</blockquote><p>We can test it out very simply; let’s suppose we want to check if some value is greater than 4 — and, as in other examples in this series of articles, let’s fake some failures if the async call gets 2 as its argument.</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/cf84e036f6954d0d75816d46a2bb7c75/href\">https://medium.com/media/cf84e036f6954d0d75816d46a2bb7c75/href</a></iframe><p>Output is as follows; as soon as one element in the array is seen to be greater than 4 (the condition we were testing for) looping stops.</p><pre>13:57:51.045 START -- using .someAsync(...) method <br>13:57:51.048 Calling - v=1 i=0 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>13:57:52.051 Success - false <br>13:57:52.051 Calling - v=2 i=1 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>13:57:54.053 Failure - error <br>13:57:54.054 Calling - v=3 i=2 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>13:57:57.057 Success - false <br><strong>13:57:57.057 Calling - v=5 i=3 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>13:58:02.062 Success - true </strong><br>13:58:02.062 END -- true</pre><p>We now know how to implement an async-aware version of some(); what about doing the same for every()?</p><h3>Implementing every()</h3><p>For a while, I thought that implementing every() would be trivial. Given that every() element of the array satisfies a given predicate if and only if there aren’t some() elements that do not satisfy it, I planned on simply basing my implementation on negating the predicate and using some(). However, that idea doesn’t work if some async calls do fail — for instance, if all calls failed, then some() would report that no elements don’t satisfy the given condition — but that really doesn’t mean that every element satisfies it! In any case, just a couple of small changes to someAsync() were enough to provide the new everyAsync() function I wanted.</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/d5412ab21f354cdd190252e51c064cc1/href\">https://medium.com/media/d5412ab21f354cdd190252e51c064cc1/href</a></iframe><p>Compare the code with someAsync() — the main differences is that we start reducing with a true value instead of false, and we use &amp;&amp; instead of ||; simple!</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/b68c292fe5d23b59f1c02dec122af726/href\">https://medium.com/media/b68c292fe5d23b59f1c02dec122af726/href</a></iframe><p>If we test it with failures, as shown above, we get a quite quick exit from the loop.</p><pre>14:06:04.894 START -- using .everyAsync(...) method <br>14:06:04.898 Calling - v=1 i=0 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>14:06:05.901 Success - true <br>14:06:05.901 Calling - v=2 i=1 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br><strong>14:06:07.904 Failure - error <br>14:06:07.904 END -- false</strong></pre><p>If we don’t simulate any failures (remove v==2 in the call to getAsyncData()) then we correctly see the loop going to the end of the array.</p><pre>14:07:29.270 START -- using .everyAsync(...) method <br>14:07:29.274 Calling - v=1 i=0 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>14:07:30.274 Success - true <br>14:07:30.274 Calling - v=2 i=1 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>14:07:32.277 Success - true <br>14:07:32.277 Calling - v=3 i=2 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>14:07:35.281 Success - true <br>14:07:35.281 Calling - v=5 i=3 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>14:07:40.287 Success - true <br>14:07:40.287 Calling - v=8 i=4 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>14:07:48.295 Success - true <br>14:07:48.296 END -- true</pre><p>Success!

Similar problems apply to map() and filter() so let’s continue our work by dealing with them.</p><h3>Mapping — a manual solution</h3><p>If you try to directly use .map() with async functions, the result won’t be what you’d probably expect.</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/1f8bd1b05ce71cb6eb82f250fea8cf6a/href\">https://medium.com/media/1f8bd1b05ce71cb6eb82f250fea8cf6a/href</a></iframe><p>The output would be as follows.</p><pre>19:58:20.008 START -- using map(...) <br>19:58:20.009 END <br><strong>Result of map:   [ <br>  Promise { &lt;pending&gt; }, <br>  Promise { &lt;pending&gt; }, <br>  Promise { &lt;pending&gt; }, <br>  Promise { &lt;pending&gt; }, <br>  Promise { &lt;pending&gt; } <br>] </strong><br>19:58:21.010 data #1 <br>19:58:23.011 data #3 <br>19:58:25.010 data #5 <br>19:58:28.013 data #8</pre><p>What’s this? We get the START message, and then END, and this is logical because .map() isn’t async-aware. The result of mapping is (correctly) an array, but instead of values, its contents are promises — one for each remote call. After logging that array, the results of the individual fake calls start coming in (and note that the 2nd call failed, as we designed, so we only get to see the returned values for the other four calls) but you still don’t get an array of values as a result.</p><p>What can we do? There are two solutions; we’ll see one here, and the other in the next section. We could just accept that the mapped array is made of promises, and use Promise.allSettled() to wait until all of them are resolved or rejected. However, that will still be an array of promises, so a further map() will be required to extract the values.</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/158ba5c1ac479339aa1f349ba9e0e198/href\">https://medium.com/media/158ba5c1ac479339aa1f349ba9e0e198/href</a></iframe><p>Now the output is as follows — first we get the array of (awaited) promises, and then the result of the final mapping, to extract the values. We get an undefined result for the failed call; we could easily produce any other result by testing the value of status.</p><pre>After awaiting:  [ <br>  { status: &#39;fulfilled&#39;, value: &#39;data #1&#39; }, <br>  { status: &#39;rejected&#39;, reason: &#39;FAILED&#39; }, <br>  { status: &#39;fulfilled&#39;, value: &#39;data #3&#39; }, <br>  { status: &#39;fulfilled&#39;, value: &#39;data #5&#39; }, <br>  { status: &#39;fulfilled&#39;, value: &#39;data #8&#39; } <br>] <br><strong>Final:  [ &#39;data #1&#39;, undefined, &#39;data #3&#39;, &#39;data #5&#39;, &#39;data #8&#39; ]</strong></pre><p>This works… but depends on the developer to do much work, first awaiting the array of promises, and then using mapping to extract the wanted values — couldn’t we do something like in the first article, and produce a .mapAsync() method that would take care of everything? Let’s do that!</p><h3>Mapping — a better solution</h3><p>After all the work we did in the previous section, coding a .mapAsync() method is simplicity itself. What did we end up doing? We first used map(), followed by waiting for all promises to be settled, and we finished by doing a new mapping to extract the values. We can put all of that together in a single (longish) line!</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/f925a6d10027c89ed038707e3208fb41/href\">https://medium.com/media/f925a6d10027c89ed038707e3208fb41/href</a></iframe><p>This is exactly what we did above, so we can just proceed to testing it.</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/a3bec394b668a0c7bfb3dd1641c7fa85/href\">https://medium.com/media/a3bec394b668a0c7bfb3dd1641c7fa85/href</a></iframe><p>Results are the same for the method and the function.</p><pre>20:24:57.971 START -- using .mapAsync(...) method <br>20:24:57.974 Calling - v=1 i=0 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>20:24:57.975 Calling - v=2 i=1 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>20:24:57.975 Calling - v=3 i=2 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>20:24:57.975 Calling - v=5 i=3 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>20:24:57.975 Calling - v=8 i=4 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>20:24:58.977 Success - data #1 <br>20:24:59.977 Failure - error <br>20:25:00.976 Success - data #3 <br>20:25:02.976 Success - data #5 <br>20:25:05.979 Success - data #8 <br><strong>20:25:05.979 END -- [data #1,,data #3,data #5,data #8]</strong></pre><p>After the START message, we see that the five calls went out in parallel. Following that, we get the five results: one failure (the 2nd, as planned) and four successes. The final result is an array with five elements: the four successful results, and an undefined value for the failed call.</p><blockquote>As in the previous article, in all cases we’ll be giving two implementations for each function — one adding to the Array.prototype (though this practice is not usually recommended…) and one as an independent function. You may pick whichever you like best.</blockquote><p>We managed to implement an async- and promise-aware version of .map(); let’s do the same now for filtering.</p><h3>Filtering</h3><p>How can we implement filtering? We could do something along the lines of .forEachAsync() as in the first part of this article, but we can do better by using the .mapAsync() function we just wrote. The idea is simple: first apply mapping to the original array to produce a list of boolean values — if an output value is true (false) it means that the original array corresponding value should be included in (excluded from) the output. This leads to another one-liner solution.</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/8d8916a9d8a5171b63c695ca490d2117/href\">https://medium.com/media/8d8916a9d8a5171b63c695ca490d2117/href</a></iframe><p>The harder part to understand is how we use .filter() on the original array, but using the mapped array’s values for filtering. Let’s see an example of the usage of our new method; we’ll filter the original array to only keep odd values. For variety, now two calls will fail.</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/101ec5ac84de73b5afd09202cb9bcf83/href\">https://medium.com/media/101ec5ac84de73b5afd09202cb9bcf83/href</a></iframe><p>The results of this run are as follows.</p><pre>20:39:15.237 START -- using .filterAsync(...) method <br>20:39:15.241 Calling - v=1 i=0 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>20:39:15.241 Calling - v=2 i=1 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>20:39:15.241 Calling - v=3 i=2 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>20:39:15.241 Calling - v=5 i=3 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>20:39:15.241 Calling - v=8 i=4 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>20:39:16.244 Success - true <br>20:39:17.243 Failure - error <br>20:39:18.243 Failure - error <br>20:39:20.243 Success - true <br>20:39:23.242 Success - false <br><strong>20:39:23.242 END -- [1,5]</strong></pre><p>All calls went out in parallel, and soon later the results started coming in — with two failures, as planned. The final filtering picks just the values 1 and 5; the filter returned false for 8, and failed for 2 and 3.

Part 1</h3><h4>Mixing loops with async calls in JavaScript produces unexpected results; how to handle looping and reducing.</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_pKUo539CcwXTWp_VP9FNw.png\" /></figure><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function\">Higher order functions</a> such as forEach(), reduce(), map(), and filter() are commonly used in JavaScript programming, but if you mix them up with async calls or promises, results probably won’t be what you would expect. The problem occurs, as we’ll see, only with these functions; “common” code won’t be affected.</p><p>In this article we’ll study and produce alternative correct implementations for forEach() and reduce(), which are quite similar in some aspects. In the <a href=\"https://medium.com/dailyjs/async-loops-and-why-they-fail-part-2-f66e5ea04113\">second part</a> of the article we’ll deal with the complementary map() and reduce() functions; in the <a href=\"https://medium.com/dailyjs/async-loops-and-why-they-fail-part-3-4cf6f8452e33\">third</a> we’ll work with some() and every(), and in the <a href=\"https://medium.com/dailyjs/async-loops-and-why-they-fail-part-4-c53f222b54aa\">fourth and last article</a> we’ll consider find() and findIndex().</p><p>By the way, we will be using the latest version of Node.js, including Promise.allSettled(), Promise.finally(), and .mjs modules, allowing us to use import and export, so we’ll also get a chance to try out these newer features! Thus, even if you don’t get to actually require mixing loops and async calls, all this work will prove an interesting exercise in JavaScript coding.</p><h3>Viewing the problem</h3><p>In order to see what the problem is, let’s start by having a fake async call, that will just wait a short time (timeToWait) and return a given value (dataToReturn). For testing purposes, sometimes we’ll also want to be able to make the call fail, so we’ll include a third parameter (fail) that will be false by default. We will use the code below for most examples.</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/e70ec3521be57cd340cce80b34eb5ae1/href\">https://medium.com/media/e70ec3521be57cd340cce80b34eb5ae1/href</a></iframe><p>We will also want a logging function including the current time, and we can make do with the following.</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/9e7c885478517744480d6f8ee31aa17a/href\">https://medium.com/media/9e7c885478517744480d6f8ee31aa17a/href</a></iframe><p>Now that we have these functions, let’s see some code. The following sequence works perfectly well — but we expected that, since there are no loops anywhere!</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/2e108c411e25cba879a9be502c5a7dc9/href\">https://medium.com/media/2e108c411e25cba879a9be502c5a7dc9/href</a></iframe><p>Running this, we get the results below, which are OK.

Kindly make sure you are aware of the implications while using promises (or async functions) as forEach callback.</em>”</p><p>This kind of problem also affects map(), reduce(), and others, so let’s see how to work around this!</p><h3>Looping</h3><p>How can we solve the forEach() problem? As we’ll be dealing with promises, the result of that method will be a promise itself. We want to go sequentially through the array, calling the provided callback each time — but not until the previous callback has finished. A simple way to manage this is to chain the new call to the previous one. We can use finally() so we’ll be able to deal with failures (ignore them) as well.</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/f43b3af29555089ee0977a22ea55a6de/href\">https://medium.com/media/f43b3af29555089ee0977a22ea55a6de/href</a></iframe><p>We make do by using .reduce() and starting with a resolved promise. For each element in the array, we call the async function in the .finally() call for the previous promise. (We could also work with both .then() and .catch() but we’d have to duplicate code.) After a promise succeeds, the next function call will go out, traversing the whole array.</p><blockquote>In all cases, we’ll be giving two implementations for each function — one by adding to the Array.prototype (though modifying a prototype is not usually recommended…) and one as a stand-alone function, and you can select the one that you prefer.</blockquote><p>Let’s see this alternative implementation work! We’ll have a getForEachData() call that will get values from our mock API call. Just for variety, we’ll have the call fail if we pass 2 as its argument. Full code is below.</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/544bc62bbd47a3a9cfb86ab7aa9f9a7b/href\">https://medium.com/media/544bc62bbd47a3a9cfb86ab7aa9f9a7b/href</a></iframe><p>Both implementations produce the same kind of result, so let’s see just one run.</p><pre>17:26:16.476 START -- using .forEachAsync(...) method <br>17:26:16.480 Calling - v=1 i=0 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>17:26:17.482 Success - data #1 <br>17:26:17.482 Calling - v=2 i=1 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>17:26:19.484 Failure - error <br>17:26:19.484 Calling - v=3 i=2 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>17:26:22.488 Success - data #3 <br>17:26:22.488 Calling - v=5 i=3 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>17:26:27.494 Success - data #5 <br>17:26:27.494 Calling - v=8 i=4 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>17:26:35.503 Success - data #8 <br>17:26:35.503 END</pre><p>Success! The sequence of logs is what we expected: an initial START, then all five calls, and a final END. And, as a plus, a very similar algorithm will work as an alternative for .reduce() — let’s see how.</p><h3>Reducing</h3><p>Reducing an array to a single value using .reduce() also requires going through all its values sequentially. I’ll admit, however, that calling a remote endpoint to do the reducing isn’t a very likely situation, but let’s just accept that for completeness’ sake.</p><p>The exact type of code we wrote above will serve — but we have the reducing process with the initial value, and each promise has to pass the updated result to the next call. We can write the following, then.</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/dd84ea9e1bb0ed3027e2949038e5d793/href\">https://medium.com/media/dd84ea9e1bb0ed3027e2949038e5d793/href</a></iframe><p>If you compare the reduceAsync() code with the previous code for forEachAsync() two things appear:</p><ul><li>we provide a promise, resolved to the initial value for reducing, to reduce()</li><li>we aren’t using .finally because we want to pass a value to the next promise; if the previous call was successful, we pass the updated accumulator, and if the call failed, we ignore it, and pass the (unchanged) accumulator.</li></ul><p>We can see this work; the code below uses our new implementation.</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/84d4f0b172daf0b25fca7e09e49d0d30/href\">https://medium.com/media/84d4f0b172daf0b25fca7e09e49d0d30/href</a></iframe><p>Our (fake) reducing call just sums the accumulator and the new value. When the passed value is 2, the call “fails” instead. The result of both loops is similar; let’s see just one.</p><pre>17:37:35.646 START -- using .reduceAsync(...) method <br>17:37:35.650 Calling - v=1 i=0 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>17:37:36.652 Success - 1 <br>17:37:36.653 Calling - v=2 i=1 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>17:37:38.655 Failure - error <br>17:37:38.655 Calling - v=3 i=2 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>17:37:41.658 Success - 4 <br>17:37:41.658 Calling - v=5 i=3 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>17:37:46.663 Success - 9 <br>17:37:46.663 Calling - v=8 i=4 a=[1,2,3,5,8] <br>17:37:54.671 Success - 17 <br>17:37:54.671 END -- 17</pre><p>All values — except 2, which was ignored because of the faked failure — were added, and the final result is 17; we’re done!</p><blockquote>What about using .reduceRight() with async calls?

By basing computational tasks on the actor primitive and assuming all actors manage their own state and all communications among actors happens asynchronously, among other things, the actor model provided a path to build complex, distributed applications that are stateful and concurrent.</p>\n<p>Bonér released the first version of Akka in 2009, with support for the JVM, and since then, the open source Akka project has been downloaded 10 million times, according to <a href=\"http://www.lightbend.com/\">Lightbend</a>, the company Bonér co-founded to develop and support Akka. Since then, the Akka project (which was written in Scala but also supports Java) has expanded into a full platform for reactive microservices that are resilient from failure and self-healing, the company says.</p>\n<p>Along the way, Akka has found its way into a range of projects. Apache Spark used Akka for communication between nodes until version 1.6, and the Apache Flink stream processing framework is still based on Akka. The toolkit is often used alongside other Java-based frameworks and databases, including Apache Cassandra and Apache Kafka. Akka is used to develop applications for IoT, machine learning, real-time streaming analytics, and digital twins.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_40833\" style=\"width: 187px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/jonas-boner.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-40833\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-40833\" src=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/jonas-boner-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"177\" height=\"177\" srcset=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/jonas-boner-300x300.png 300w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/jonas-boner-150x150.png 150w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/jonas-boner-200x200.png 200w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/jonas-boner-100x100.png 100w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/jonas-boner-120x120.png 120w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/jonas-boner.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 177px) 100vw, 177px\" /></a></p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-40833\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Akka creator and Lightbend CTO Jonas Bonér</em></p>\n</div>\n<p>The new Akka Cloud Platform that Lightbend unveiled today is based on its Akka Platform and includes the core building blocks for building reactive microservices that are stateful and leverage the scale of the Web.

Early prototypes such as Microsoft’s <a href=\"https://www.enterpriseai.news/2020/09/18/microsoft-data-sub-yields-reliability-gains/\">submersible data center</a> address cooling requirements and reliability issues.</p>\n<p>Still, the ongoing problem is scale, and finding disruptive ways of securely storing and accessing exabytes of data without breaking the bank.</p>\n<p>A New York-based startup has seen the light, proposing to launch a satellite constellation equipped with ultra-high bandwidth lasers that would serve as an orbiting hyperscale data center capable of storing and securing data in perpetual motion.</p>\n<p>LyteLoop announced a follow-on $40 million funding round earlier this month that will help the five-year startup move its photonics-based data storage architecture from the laboratory to orbit. The concept employs ultra-high bandwidth lasers to store data as light, then transmits it between satellites in “a constant state of perpetual motion.”</p>\n<p>Traditional data center architectures consist of processing, storage and transport, the latter two being separate layers. “We’re replacing the storage with the [photonics] link,” said LyteLoop CEO Ohad Harlev. “The link is the storage.”</p>\n<p>Among the startup’s value propositions is using photonics to replace the costly data transport layer, Harlev noted in an interview, greatly reducing operational costs.</p>\n<p>Along with scale, LytleLoop promises global coverage that would provide data access from nearly anywhere on Earth. Harlev also notes the proposed constellation’s extra layers of data security enabled by photonics technology—security he said would be physically impossible on the ground.</p>\n<p>Those layers include quantum encryption and the security and privacy advantages of data in constant motion while moving at the speed of light.</p>\n<p>In laboratory tests, LyteLoop’s working prototype has been able to transmit and receive large data files error-free at simulated distances of 300 billion kilometers. By comparison, the <a href=\"https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status/\"><em>Voyager 1</em></a> spacecraft has traveled about 22.7 billion kilometers from Earth since its launch in 1977.</p>\n<p>LyteLoop said it latest funding round moves it closer to goal of launching six prototype satellites within three years. If that deadline is met, Harlev expects the laser-powered data storage satellite constellation to be operational in about five years.</p>\n<p>“We’re good to go for the next three years,” he added.</p>\n<p>Having recently determined the details of it proposed satellite constellation, including the number and types of satellites needed in low-earth and geosynchronous orbits, the startup has recently open discussions with multiple launch providers.</p>\n<p>LyteLoop engineers are meanwhile designing the satellite payload, using proprietary technology to build optics, photonics, aperture arrays and core avionics. The payload will be integrated by the startup with a third-party satellite bus.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to start slow and steady” with the six-satellite proof-of-concept by 2024, Harlov said, then scale the constellation. “We’re trying to be a data center operator,” he added, hence the startup will work with other low-earth orbit access providers to secure downlinks.</p>\n<p>The company asserts that data center storage advances have been mostly evolutionary. In the era of big data, the CEO argues, the next steps in storage and transport must be “revolutionary.” The current enterprise state of the art are exascale-class terrestrial data centers such as Facebook’s 1-exabyte storage warehouse.</p>\n<p>Once operational, Harlev said LyteLoop’s space-based photonics approach could double that amount of data storage while adding layers of security and privacy.</p>\n<p><strong>Recent items:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.datanami.com/2020/12/09/european-space-agency-uses-ai-satellites-to-monitor-pandemic-air-traffic/\">European Space Agency Uses AI, Satellites to Monitor Pandemic Air Traffic</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.datanami.com/2020/10/28/the-object-store-of-your-desire/\">The Object (Store) of Your Desire</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.datanami.com/2021/02/23/space-based-storage-prepares-for-launch/\">Space-Based Storage Prepares for Launch</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.datanami.com\">Datanami</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://www.datanami.com/2021/02/23/space-based-storage-prepares-for-launch/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">40828</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>AI Experts Discuss Implications of GPT-3</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.datanami.com/2021/02/23/ai-experts-discuss-implications-of-gpt-3/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=ai-experts-discuss-implications-of-gpt-3</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<comments>https://www.datanami.com/2021/02/23/ai-experts-discuss-implications-of-gpt-3/#respond</comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Oliver Peckham]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 19:54:51 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Features]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[ethics]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[GPT-2]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[GPT-3]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[OpenAI]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Stanford]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.datanami.com/?p=40807</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Last July, GPT-3 took the internet by storm.

The massive 175 billion-parameter autoregressive language model, developed by OpenAI, showed a startling ability to translate languages, answer questions, and – perhaps most eerily – generate its own coherent passages, poems, and songs when given examples to process. As it turns out, experts were captivated by these abilities, too: captivated enough, in fact, that researchers from OpenAI and a number of universities met several months ago to discuss the technical and sociopolitical implications of the platform.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The summit, helmed by <a href=\"https://openai.com/\">OpenAI</a> in partnership with Stanford’s <a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/\">Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence</a>, convened in October. Apart from those two institutions, the remainder of the participants are currently unknown by the public, as the meeting was held under the Chatham House Rule, whereby a meeting’s information is public but its participants are secret.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/openai-logo-e1614102982920.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-40808\" src=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/openai-logo-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" /></a>On the table: two key questions on the future of large language models like GPT-3. First: what are the technical capabilities and limitations of those models? Second: what are the societal effects of widespread use of those models?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The summary of the summit was written by Alex Tamkin, Miles Brundage, Jack Clark, and Deep Ganguli, who characterized the conversation as “collegial and productive,” but added that “there was a sense of urgency to make progress sooner than later in answering these questions.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what’d they talk about?</span></p>\n<h3><b>Technical Trends</b></h3>\n<p><b>Exponential expansion. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GPT-3 is larger than its predecessor, GPT-2, by more than two orders of magnitude (175 billion parameters versus 1.5 billion parameters). One participant said that the growth in model capabilities feel as reliable as the laws of physics or thermodynamics, and several said they expected these rapid trends to continue.</span></p>\n<p><b>Necessary collaboration. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In one case, a participant compared large language models to particle accelerator experiments, citing how both tools require experts from a wide range of backgrounds to construct and operate.</span></p>\n<p><b>An unclear bar for “understanding.” </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The classic AI question: what is intelligence, and how intelligent is “intelligent?” The participants were divided on how to assess GPT-3’s intelligence: some argued it should be defined by its ability to respond to requests in the real world; some said it needed to overcome hurdles intended to confuse AI; some countered that causality, rather than correlation, was necessary; and yet others argued against a binary understanding of intelligence altogether, the importance of intelligence as a concept, and even </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">our</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ability to understand GPT-3. “GPT-3 is completely a</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lien,” one participant said. “It’s the first thing I’ve seen where it’s not a dumb thing to ask whether </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it’s [artificial general intelligence].”</span></p>\n<p><b>A bright future for multimodal models. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Participants generally agreed that multimodal language models – which also train on data from images, audio, and so on – will become more prevalent and enable more functionality. Some participants even suggested that GPT-3 is already multimodal, since the forms of data it processes are so diverse.</span></p>\n<p><b>A need to align with human values. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was discussion over how large language models could better incorporate human values into their decision making: humans, some explained, care more about errors that have value implications than they do about grammatical errors.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Sociopolitical Implications</b></h3>\n<p><b>Access concerns&#8230; </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, OpenAI restricts access to GPT-3’s API. Some participants questioned this: who receives access, and why? How can the model be effectively evaluated for biases if it’s not available at scale?</span></p>\n<p><b>… and concerns over responsible deployment. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GPT-3’s language generation is, in many cases, incredibly convincing. Participants discussed how that ability could be abused, including through active disinformation or propaganda campaigns that appear to have been written by a human. Some disagreed, expressing confidence that modern society has encountered enough analogues in other fields (e.g. Photoshop) to be cautious about fake information.</span></p>\n<p><b>Ideas for identifying real information. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some participants floated ideas for tackling AI-generated language: one floated laws requiring disclosure when AI is used to generate text, while another suggested increased investment in cryptography to authenticate human-generated media.</span></p>\n<p><b>A need for OpenAI to set norms.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Participants agreed that OpenAI’s advantage is unlikely to remain for more than a handful of months before others catch up and, as a result, stressed the need for OpenAI to set socially healthy norms around the use of large language models.</span></p>\n<p><b>Worrying biases. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since GPT-3 pulls its generated language from observed language, it exhibits many of the demographic biases that pervade much modern language, media, and conversation. Participants noted the difficulty of addressing these biases in any kind of systemic way, since biases are often highly contextual. Many suggested that the most harmful biases, at least, should be proactively addressed, but others countered that OpenAI should not be the one to make those decisions. Participants suggested solutions ranging from better-labeled data and reinforcement learning to suites of bias tests and carefully targeted deployment.</span></p>\n<p><b>Potential impacts on jobs and the economy. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As GPT-3’s abilities begin to near the responsibilities of rote writing and moderation jobs, it is increasingly likely that AI models might begin to replace some of those jobs.

Virtually every enterprise is accelerating digital transformation, either creating new, digital-native projects or augmenting critical systems with new digital capabilities.</p>\n<p>Nearly all digital transformation is data intensive. Rapid access to the right data provides everything from accurate information and recommendations to the critical identity checks needed to ensure that people are who they say they are in a contactless transaction.</p>\n<p>In this article, I’d like to zero in on how modern data infrastructures can fuel the critical authentication and identity practices required for a contactless world.</p>\n<h3>Experience Is King and Customers Crave Convenience</h3>\n<p>The amount of effort a customer puts into a digital transaction directly correlates to the satisfaction of that experience. The simpler and faster, the better. It’s not going to be enough to just digitize business if experiences do not perform at the speed of expectations.</p>\n<p>What’s one of the greatest frustrations (for customers) and fears (for business) in a digital world? Authentication. In the race to get online, or complete transactions in an impatient world, proving identity has always been a speed bump, both for the transaction and psychologically for consumers. Digital business won’t leap forward if we don’t make authentication simple, accurate and frictionless. Yet at the same time, security and privacy remain paramount. There have always been tradeoffs between security and convenience; however, with modern data architectures those tradeoffs are disappearing.</p>\n<h3>Current Mainstream Authentication Is On Its Way Out</h3>\n<p>There remain plenty of security issues with digital commerce, as user errors, two-factor authentication and passwords just haven’t proven enough to stop bad actors. According to <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/embrace-a-passwordless-approach-to-improve-security/\">Gartner</a>, these approaches are also on their way out. Three years ago the firm declared that by 2022, over half of large global enterprises (and many more smaller ones) will move to password-less methods for most use cases.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_40804\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/password_shutterstock_JMiks.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-40804\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-40804\" src=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/password_shutterstock_JMiks-300x199.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" srcset=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/password_shutterstock_JMiks-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/password_shutterstock_JMiks-768x510.jpg 768w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/password_shutterstock_JMiks-200x133.jpg 200w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/password_shutterstock_JMiks-100x66.jpg 100w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/password_shutterstock_JMiks-120x80.jpg 120w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/password_shutterstock_JMiks.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-40804\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>(JMiks/Shutterstock)</em></p>\n</div>\n<p>The time is right. Advances in big data let us use tens, even hundreds of data points instantly for many things, including confirming identity (more on that later). But also, we’ve crossed the line where digital documents, identities, and transactions, once outliers, are now mainstream and <em>preferred </em>by businesses and consumers. They’ve surpassed traditional analog and physical methods. Even paper documents came with high assumptions that those documents were legitimate when presented in person.</p>\n<h3>Modern Fraud Prevention Provides a Template for Success</h3>\n<p><em> </em>It’s time that we leverage new data architectures more aggressively. Some of the most forward-looking financial services companies (like PayPal, Experian and others) already leverage vast amounts of data to quickly pinpoint identity. Without it, the great digital leap could easily stall against the headwinds of customer convenience.</p>\n<p>A fraud prevention application has to review a user profile, test the request against patterns determined by data scientists, and make a “yes” or “no” decision as to whether the activity is legitimate. The enormous and ever-changing dataset of requester information only adds complexity to the equation. But sophisticated database technology not only makes it possible to immediately identify anomalies and false positives, it’s light years ahead of previous analog methods of combating fraud. Applying the ability to check recent updates to dozens of data sources in milliseconds must be used to validate the authentication process on a broad scale.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at <a href=\"https://www.aerospike.com/resources/videos/the-science-behind-delightful-user-experience/\">PayPal</a>. It has more than 300 million users worldwide, with a data infrastructure supporting 60 billion queries a day and payment volumes in excess of $700 billion annually. Data scale challenges include hundreds of petabytes and a requirement to grow from 3.5 to 7 million transactions a second.</p>\n<p>By leveraging next-generation data architectures, it has not only implemented authentication beyond standard passwords, but more importantly, implemented a next generation fraud detection system. It merged “big data” with “fast data,” such as customer enrollment, payment, invoicing preferences, profile data, etc., as well as real-time information on the details of the customer’s recent activities like geographic location, intermediate network gateways, device identity, etc. This comprehensive approach created a real-time fraud decisioning platform that is effective — and with minimal end-user friction. It’s this type of integrated model that helps map the way for future authentication strategies.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_40817\" style=\"width: 325px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/privacy_shutterstock_one-photo.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-40817\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-40817\" src=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/privacy_shutterstock_one-photo-300x215.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"315\" height=\"226\" srcset=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/privacy_shutterstock_one-photo-300x215.jpg 300w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/privacy_shutterstock_one-photo-200x143.jpg 200w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/privacy_shutterstock_one-photo-100x72.jpg 100w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/privacy_shutterstock_one-photo-120x86.jpg 120w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/privacy_shutterstock_one-photo.jpg 668w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px\" /></a></p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-40817\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>(one photo/Shutterstock)</em></p>\n</div>\n<p>Another useful example is Experian. The company’s CrossCore identity and fraud risk platform consolidates and orchestrates numerous fraud risk signals into a single, holistic assessment to improve operational processes, stay ahead of fraudsters and protect customers. During the past year, Experian helped clients screen more than 15 billion fraud events — more than 3,300 per second. Experian uses a modern NoSQL database to support low-latency, high-throughput cloud data storage for device intelligence and fraud management. The service enables Experian to help businesses improve response times and deliver a safe, convenient and frictionless customer experience.</p>\n<h3>The Shifting Privacy Obstacles</h3>\n<p>The most vocal objections will come from those concerned with data privacy. Digitizing everything means that all of an individual’s identity sources will be stored and maintained by strangers. People may have a sense that they are no longer in control of their identity. To a degree, we’re already a long way down that road. But individuals still feel&#8211;rightly or wrongly&#8211;as if they have some control now. In an all-digital world, there will be valid concerns about private information being misused and vulnerable to cyber-thieves.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, privacy legislation is in full force with GDPR (in Europe), CCPA and the newly passed CPRA in California, and many other examples within specific markets (HIPAA) and regions. This requires more control both to stay within the accepted, legislated boundaries and the expectations of companies and customers. Here are three facts worth remembering:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Customer data must be protected so trust can be established between customer and vendor;</li>\n<li>Any customer requests for data management as required by compliance requirements must be complied with and recorded for future auditing;</li>\n<li>The penalty for not complying could result in business losses through brand damage, customer churn and steep fines from regulatory agencies.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The future of the business is based on leveraging data. Improper data usage may land the business in deep trouble on multiple fronts. Those that are meticulous stewards of customer data are much more likely to thrive.</p>\n<p>These concerns will need to be addressed thoughtfully. Making digital verification mandatory is one way to increase compliance. But a better way to earn the trust and support of customers is to offer a fast, pleasant and frictionless experience.</p>\n<p>We’re quickly moving toward a day when this will be a nearly “contactless world.” To get there, companies know they have to master digital authentication and all the data challenges that come with it. Do it quickly, and you’ll reap the benefits.<a href=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Srini-Srinivasn.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-24533 alignright\" src=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Srini-Srinivasn-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"204\" height=\"204\" srcset=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Srini-Srinivasn-300x300.png 300w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Srini-Srinivasn-150x150.png 150w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Srini-Srinivasn-200x200.png 200w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Srini-Srinivasn-100x100.png 100w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Srini-Srinivasn-120x120.png 120w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Srini-Srinivasn.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 204px) 100vw, 204px\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>About the author: Srini Srinivasan is the founder and chief product officer at </em><a href=\"http://www.aerospike.com\"><em>Aerospike</em></a><em>, a developer of next-generation, real-time NoSQL data solutions.

PwC pegged it as a $2.5 trillion opportunity by 2025. But getting projects greenlit for long term deployment can be quite difficult, especially with budget shortfalls. A successful deployment of a smart city project near Sydney, Australia, can be instructive for how local governments can get the ball rolling.</p>\n<p>Parramatta is a major commercial suburb of Sydney, and the second-oldest city in the country. Following the Great Recession, a large pharmaceutical company moved out of town, leading developers to propose building a large housing complex on the former campus. When neighbors raised concerns about the impact of construction noise and dust in the heart of the city, planners required the developers to deploy a series of sensors to monitor air quality and noise levels.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://aus.ui.city/\">Urban Institute</a> won the contract to build a system to manage data coming from several hundred sensors. The non-profit organization developed the application atop a streaming data analytics platform supplied  by <a href=\"http://www.kx.com/\">KX</a>, its primary technology partner.</p>\n<p>The initial use case was primarily defensive, says Simon Kaplan, Urban Institute’s CEO for the APAC region.</p>\n<p>“If somebody calls up and says ‘The jackhammers were running at 6 Sunday morning,’ they will be able to say ‘Oh now, we checked the data, that wasn’t happening,’ or ‘Yes it was, we had to go shout at somebody because it’s naughty of them,’” Kaplan says.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_40784\" style=\"width: 407px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smart-city_shutterstock_elenabsl.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-40784\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-40784\" src=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smart-city_shutterstock_elenabsl-300x148.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"397\" height=\"196\" srcset=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smart-city_shutterstock_elenabsl-300x148.jpg 300w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smart-city_shutterstock_elenabsl-768x379.jpg 768w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smart-city_shutterstock_elenabsl-200x99.jpg 200w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smart-city_shutterstock_elenabsl-100x49.jpg 100w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smart-city_shutterstock_elenabsl-120x59.jpg 120w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smart-city_shutterstock_elenabsl.jpg 939w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px\" /></a></p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-40784\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Smart cities projects are projected to drive $2.5 trillion in spending by 2025, according to PwC (elenabsl/Shutterstock)</em></p>\n</div>\n<p>When construction crews finished sections of the new development, and the air was no longer filled with dust and the sounds of jackhammers, the city of Parramatta found that the sensors and the data were still providing value to the residents of the city, and so it decided to leave them in place.</p>\n<p>“It’s turned into a much broader project,” Kaplan tells <em>Datanami</em>. “There’s no point in taking the sensors down now, because it turns out, as blocks of this become livable, you get all sorts of information about urban [living] and things like that that they’re trying to understand.”</p>\n<p>For example, Paramatta installed sensors to monitor runoff from the construction sites into local streams. Now those sensors are being used to track more natural sources of pollution (or at least the regular urban runoff). The city makes that data available to citizens via a dashboarding feature in the KX software suite.</p>\n<p>“The residents love it,” Kaplan says. “They’ve got public dashboards and they can open it up and say look, there’s pollution today or everything is clear, so it has served many functions.”</p>\n<p>Kaplan credits the KX software as a key factor in its success. “If we didn’t have KX as a product, we literally wouldn’t be able to do that. We would have had to build too much software,” he says. “KX takes that problem off the table, which is brilliant…It’s not an exaggeration to say we would not have survived as a startup if we had not formed this partnership.”</p>\n<p>The Parramatta project was important for another reason, Kaplan says. It was the first one that transcended the pilot stage and the city commits to keeping it going long term. Since then, Urban Institute has worked with half a dozen other Australian cities to implement data collection applications as part of smart cities projects.</p>\n<p>The project worked because the city welcomed input from the residents, and was upfront about what the benefits would be. In fact, the residents essentially co-designed the project, Kaplan says.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_40785\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Smart-Streetlight_SD.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-40785\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-40785\" src=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Smart-Streetlight_SD-300x198.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"198\" srcset=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Smart-Streetlight_SD-300x198.png 300w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Smart-Streetlight_SD-768x506.png 768w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Smart-Streetlight_SD-200x132.png 200w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Smart-Streetlight_SD-100x66.png 100w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Smart-Streetlight_SD-120x79.png 120w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Smart-Streetlight_SD.png 936w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-40785\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>San Diego has turned off the sensors in its Smart Streetlight program</em></p>\n</div>\n<p>The success in Parramatta is unique. Many smart city projects start out with a bang but end with a whimper. Finding a way out of this pattern and hitting upon a recipe for regular success is arguably a bigger challenge than the technology side of the equation.</p>\n<p>“Part of the challenge is that everybody knows that collecting better urban data will be useful. But there’s not really yet strong use cases as to why, so there’s a lot of experimenting going on all over the world,” Kaplan says.</p>\n<p>COVID-19 is helping in some ways. Just as businesses have accelerated digital strategies, the pandemic is leading local governments to find digital alternatives to in-person activities. Considering the amount of land that local governments are in charge of&#8211;not to mention the electrical grid, water system, roads, and services cities often provide atop that land&#8211;this is no small task.</p>\n<p>“In the old days, if something didn’t seem like it was working, you could send two guys in a truck to go down and have a look,” Kaplan says. “Now, every time you do that, you have to think about a whole new family of risks. So if you can have the sensors tell you what’s wrong …. we can apply analytics to the data to learn what the problems are, [and that] means that the city can make better designs about how to deploy resources. That on its own is worth millions of dollars of year to a city.”</p>\n<p>Not all smart city projects are panning out. For example, starting in 2016, the city of San Diego, California spent millions to install 3,000 “smart streetlights” that contained video and still cameras, in addition to efficient LED lights that are dimmable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/UI-Logo.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-40837 alignright\" src=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/UI-Logo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"152\" height=\"76\" srcset=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/UI-Logo.png 110w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/UI-Logo-100x50.png 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 152px) 100vw, 152px\" /></a>The crux of the idea was to use the network of sensors to provide data about traffic patterns, parking, bicycle and pedestrian usage, as well as weather data (temperature, humidity, and air pressure). But last September, following public outcry that the local police were using images from the streetlights to solve crimes, the city elected to turn off the program.</p>\n<p>Despite the setback, Kaplan is committed that deployments such as San Diego’s will prove to be a success in the long run. “Those cameras in the streetlights in San Diego are particularly useful if you use them for things like parking enforcement. You don’t’ have to use them to track people,” he says. “It’s not like London, where they’ve got a whole bunch of cameras mounted two foot above your eyeline everywhere. That’s a hell of a lot more intrusive than the use case in San Diego.”</p>\n<p>KX has about 25 smart cities projects in the Australia and New Zealand region, and it’s only growing, says Andy Churchill, KX&#8217;s managing director for the region.</p>\n<p>“The trend is more sensors, not less,” Churchill says. “And the trend is high frequency. So  capturing more information and a closer frequency. The data is only increasing. The volume is increasing. It’s not like the decisions are slowing down. They need to speed up as well. If you’ve got a main gas leak, you need to know about that quickly. With a water main burst, you’re losing a scarce resource.”</p>\n<p>According to PwC, there will be <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/capital-projects-infrastructure/library/future-smart-cities.html\">$1.2 trillion spent on smart cities initiatives this year</a>. Even if that figure is inflated, there’s no denying the upward trend of spending. PwC says one of the main drivers of the spending will be a desire for “government bodies….to transform the lives, wellbeing and safety of their citizens.”</p>\n<p>The key for success with smart cities projects is the same as with any big data initiative: start small with a relatively easy project and get a quick win under your belt, which will whet the customers’ appetite for more as well as provide funding for larger projects down the road.</p>\n<p>It’s much cheaper to find and fix potholes when they’re small than waiting for them to grow into chassis-smashing craters. High-efficient LED street lighting can cut millions off of a city’s electrical bill. “These are the low-hanging fruit, the places where the relationship of using the data and the financial return to the city, even in terms of new revenue or reduced cost, are obvious,” Kaplan says. “That’s where people will begin.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, we’ll get to 5G networks of self-driving cars, but not now. “I think there’s little appetite for wild-eyed speculative projects for a while, unless you can persuade a Google or somebody with deep pockets to fund it on your behalf,” he says. “Ten years from now, if we have this conversation, we’ll laugh at these use cases, and we’ll have much better ones. But we won’t know where they are until we get there.”</p>\n<p><strong>Related Items:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.datanami.com/2020/10/29/kx-systems-a-historical-need-for-speed/\">Kx Systems: A Historical Need for Speed</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.datanami.com/2020/11/13/when-it-comes-to-data-transfer-5g-is-just-the-beginning/\">When it Comes to Data Transfer, 5G is Just the Beginning</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.datanami.com/2015/09/16/u-s-smart-cities-effort-targets-data-apps/\">U.S. Smart Cities Effort Targets Data Apps</a></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.datanami.com/2021/02/22/getting-a-foot-in-the-door-for-smart-city-projects/\">Getting a Foot in the Door for Smart City Projects</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.datanami.com\">Datanami</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://www.datanami.com/2021/02/22/getting-a-foot-in-the-door-for-smart-city-projects/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">40783</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Nvidia Opens the Door to Deep Learning Workshops</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.datanami.com/2021/02/19/nvidia-opens-the-door-to-deep-learning-workshops/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=nvidia-opens-the-door-to-deep-learning-workshops</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<comments>https://www.datanami.com/2021/02/19/nvidia-opens-the-door-to-deep-learning-workshops/#respond</comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Alex Woodie]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 22:43:25 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[News in Brief]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Deep Learning Institute]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[education]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[training]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.datanami.com/?p=40738</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Good news for folks looking to learn about the latest AI development techniques: Nvidia is now allowing the general public to access the online workshops it provides through its Deep Learning Institute (DLI).

These workshops previously were available only to companies that wanted specialized training for their in-house developers, or to folks who had attended the company’s GPU Technology Conferences.</p>\n<p>Two of the open courses will take place next month, including “Fundamentals of Accelerated Computing with CUDA Python,” which explores developing parallel workloads with CUDA and NumPy and cost $500. There is also “Applications of AI for Predictive Maintenance,” which explores technologies like XGBoost, LSTM, Keras, and Tensorflow, and costs $700. Certificates are available for those who complete both workshops.</p>\n<p>The course fees cover access to GPU-accelerated development servers in the cloud, as well as learning material and instructors. Thirteen more courses will be held throughout April and May 2021. You can see the full schedule at <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/02/19/deep-learning-training-workshops/\">https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/02/19/deep-learning-training-workshops/</a>.</p>\n<p>Nvidia’s DLI includes about 40 courses across four topics&#8211;deep learning, accelerated computing, data science, and infrastructure topics. Some of the courses are free, while others are available for a fee.</p>\n<p>Demand for deep learning and AI training has increased in recent years. Nvidia says that it trained 75,000 developers through the DLI in 2020, a 36% increase over 2019. Opening the workshops up to the general public will increase participation, according to Will Ramey, global head of Developer Programs at Nvidia.</p>\n<p>“Our public workshops provide a great opportunity for individual developers and smaller organizations to get industry-leading training in deep learning, accelerated computing and data science,” Ramey says in a blog. “Now the same expert instructors and world-class learning materials that help accelerate innovation at leading companies are available to everyone.”</p>\n<p><strong>Related Items:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.datanami.com/2021/02/16/one-model-to-rule-them-all-transformer-networks-usher-in-ai-2-0-forrester-says/\">One Model to Rule Them All: Transformer Networks Usher in AI 2.0, Forrester Says</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.datanami.com/2020/11/26/optimizing-ai-and-deep-learning-performance/\">Optimizing AI and Deep Learning Performance</a></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.datanami.com/2021/02/19/nvidia-opens-the-door-to-deep-learning-workshops/\">Nvidia Opens the Door to Deep Learning Workshops</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.datanami.com\">Datanami</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://www.datanami.com/2021/02/19/nvidia-opens-the-door-to-deep-learning-workshops/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">40738</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The Value of Practical AI</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.datanami.com/whitepaper/the-value-of-practical-ai/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=the-value-of-practical-ai</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Ana Ware]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 13:00:14 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.datanami.com/?post_type=papers&#038;p=40670</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Business executives have notoriously struggled to assess the business value of AI.

Are you ready for it? According to Accenture, only 7% of organizations today have made the necessary investments in data science and AI to be considered “future-ready,” and they will reap enormous rewards from the work they have put in (even with COVID-19). But the good news is the system integrator sees a rising tide of all boats thanks to data and AI in the future.</p>\n<p>In its new report, titled <a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/operations/future-ready-operations\">“Fast Track to Future-Ready Performance,”</a> Accenture surveyed 1,100 executives in 11 countries and 13 industries to gauge how their digital transformation journeys correlate with use of emerging technologies, like AI, analytics, cloud, blockchain, and robotic process automation (RPA).</p>\n<p>Accenture found that, three years ago, about four in five organizations fell in the bottom half of the spectrum. About one in five organizations were stuck at the “Stable” level, which is marked by a use of foundational tools and technologies, little automation, and siloed data. These organizations focus on using tech to make core process and quality improvements; they are largely incapable of using data to look ahead.</p>\n<p>More than 60% sat in the “Efficient” category three years ago, which meant they automated some aspects of their businesses, including augmenting human workers with machines and aggregating data at the organizational level. Some have even adopted Lean Six Sigma approaches. But they mostly lack the agility to move quickly with data.</p>\n<p>Today, strategic and transformational uses of technology are growing more common. About one-third of organizations are still in the “Efficient” category, but nearly 60% have moved up to the “Predictive” category, which is marked by wider use of data science, machines helping with the majority of business processes, and widespread use of blended data. Companies here have teams that are more agile, and they’re gaining efficiency advantages at a higher rate.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_40682\" style=\"width: 429px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Accenture_study.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-40682\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-40682\" src=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Accenture_study-300x164.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"419\" height=\"229\" srcset=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Accenture_study-300x164.png 300w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Accenture_study-1024x561.png 1024w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Accenture_study-768x420.png 768w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Accenture_study-1536x841.png 1536w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Accenture_study-200x109.png 200w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Accenture_study-100x55.png 100w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Accenture_study-120x66.png 120w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Accenture_study.png 1657w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 419px) 100vw, 419px\" /></a></p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-40682\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Future-ready organizations are becoming more common (Graphic courtesy Accenture&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/operations/future-ready-operations\">“Fast Track to Future-Ready Performance”</a>)</em></p>\n</div>\n<p>Meanwhile, about 7% of organizations today have achieved the Holy Grail of Accenture’s rating system and achieved “Future-ready” status, which is marked by widespread use of technologies like AI, cloud, and blockchain. Processes are largely automated, end to end, and organizations coordinate to use data and analytics in a strategic manner, which makes them more resilient. In three years, about one-third of firms will be here, Accenture says, while 60% will be one step down in the Predictive phase. Six percent will be in the Efficient state, but, curiously, no firms will be left in the Stable category.</p>\n<p>Moving up the data and AI ladder brings big benefits. According to Accenture, Future-ready organizations enjoy profits that are 2.8X higher, on average, than those in the other three categories. Their efficiency rating is 1.7X higher, too, Accenture found. All told, if all of the organizations in the world were to be operating at a Future-ready level, it would generate $5.4 trillion in additional value around the world.</p>\n<p>One of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic is that it helped to shine a light on the value of digital transformation, says Manish Sharma, group CEO for Accenture Operations.</p>\n<p>“While most businesses were unprepared for the impact of COVID-19, a strong digital foundation helped them mitigate risks and pivot quickly to keep their business running at pace,” Sharma tells <em>Datanami</em>. “What this also says is the remaining 93% are leaving money on the table.”</p>\n<p>Having a strategy to embrace data-driven decision making is good. But without the right talent, infrastructure, and processes around it, an organization may not get all the benefits, Sharma says. “The combination of those factors is the defining characteristic of ‘future-ready,’” he says.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_40681\" style=\"width: 452px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Accenture_study_2.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-40681\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-40681\" src=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Accenture_study_2-300x173.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"442\" height=\"255\" srcset=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Accenture_study_2-300x173.png 300w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Accenture_study_2-1024x590.png 1024w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Accenture_study_2-768x443.png 768w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Accenture_study_2-200x115.png 200w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Accenture_study_2-100x58.png 100w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Accenture_study_2-120x69.png 120w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Accenture_study_2.png 1105w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px\" /></a></p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-40681\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>The four stages of digital transformation (Graphic courtesy Accenture&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/operations/future-ready-operations\">“Fast Track to Future-Ready Performance”</a>)</em></p>\n</div>\n<p>Breaking down data silos and embracing cross-organizational data collaboration is a key requirement to moving beyond a straight transactional approach and toward a strategic one, he adds.</p>\n<p>“Once organizations make that leap to being future-ready, diverse data is being combined with analytics and AI capabilities in a holistic approach,” Sharma explains. “By using diverse data and elevating data quality, business leaders will be able to combine the best of both in a continuous feedback loop and inform better decision-making.”</p>\n<p>Here are other interesting correlations that emerged from Accenture’s investigation into future-ready orgs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Future-ready organizations are 10 times more likely as other organizations (52% vs. 5%) to use analytics at scale;</li>\n<li>They are about 8 times more likely to use diverse data sets (45% vs. 6%) to generate insights;</li>\n<li>And 75% of future-ready organizations are expected to use analytics with diverse data by 2023.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using diverse data is important to moving up the ladder. Accenture also found widespread use of cloud for crunching data among Future-ready organizations. Organizations on the cutting edge will also leverage their ecosystem partners to help get ahead of the game, especially with data and skills, Accenture found.</p>\n<p>Aligning your own organization’s data strategy with what Accenture’s Future-ready organization are doing would seem like a good bet. But there are potential pitfalls in trying to match moves line for line. Every company is different, and every company has to craft its own path to the future.</p>\n<p>On that topic, Sharma provided this bit of wisdom:</p>\n<p>“Digital transformation on such a large scale can seem daunting. By aligning to the overall business strategy, companies should see technology as part of changing how work gets done.

PIXL is a lunchbox-size instrument carried at the end of Perseverance&#8217;s 7-foot-long robotic arm. Using a coring drill on the end of the arm, the rover will collect core samples from the planet that will be left on the Mars surface for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PVjj0PEPMA&amp;list=PLTiv_XWHnOZpzQKYC6nLf6M9AuBbng_O8\">collection by a future mission</a>.</p>\n<p>AI will also be used aboard Perseverance for navigation on the planet’s surface over the life of its mission, as well as for the landing and a variety of other scientific tasks. The mission is scheduled to last for at least one Martian year, which is about 687 Earth days.</p>\n<p>But before the rover can ever use any of those AI capabilities, it will have to endure its actual landing on the surface, which is being called the riskiest approach ever by any spacecraft heading to Mars.</p>\n<p>Perseverance is <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/timeline/landing/watch-online/\">scheduled to land</a> on the red planet’s surface about 3:55 pm EST on Feb. 18 after what is billed as a harrowing approach that mission engineers have dubbed as “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4tdMR5HLtg&amp;list=PLTiv_XWHnOZqCrMU2ppcLjRn1zlDkNx3q\">seven minutes of terror</a>,” according to NASA. That’s how long it takes for scientists and engineers at NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to learn how the landing went due to delays in getting mission telemetry data across the 293 million miles between the Earth and Mars.</p>\n<p>You can read the rest of this story on our sister site, EnterpriseAI, by <a href=\"https://www.enterpriseai.news/2021/02/17/nasas-latest-mars-rover-perseverance-will-get-help-from-ai-on-the-red-planet/\">clicking here</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.datanami.com/2021/02/18/the-ai-inside-nasas-latest-mars-rover-perseverance/\">The AI Inside NASA’s Latest Mars Rover, Perseverance</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.datanami.com\">Datanami</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://www.datanami.com/2021/02/18/the-ai-inside-nasas-latest-mars-rover-perseverance/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">40674</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Analytics Show Facebook Coddling Trump&#8217;s Falsehoods</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.datanami.com/2021/02/18/analytics-show-facebook-coddling-trumps-falsehoods/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=analytics-show-facebook-coddling-trumps-falsehoods</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<comments>https://www.datanami.com/2021/02/18/analytics-show-facebook-coddling-trumps-falsehoods/#respond</comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Oliver Peckham]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2021 20:00:06 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[News in Brief]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[facebook]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[social media]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[The Markup]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Trump]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.datanami.com/?p=40629</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Former president and formerly prolific tweeter Donald Trump has been banned from most major social media sites since the days following the attack on the U.S. Capitol.

In the intervening weeks, many of those sites have been forced to grapple with Trump’s extensive litany of falsehoods that were, until the last weeks of his presidency, by and large amplified by their platforms. Currently, one of those platforms – Facebook – is on the verge of announcing whether or not they will lift restrictions on Trump’s account. Ahead of that announcement, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Markup</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has <a href=\"https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/02/16/trumps-false-posts-were-treated-with-kid-gloves-by-facebook\">published</a> an analysis of Facebook’s handling of false posts, concluding that Facebook generally treated falsehoods with “kid gloves” – particularly when it came to Trump’s.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The analysis used </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Markup</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s <a href=\"https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser\">Citizen Browser project</a>, which uses a desktop app to regularly collect HTML source code and screenshots of Facebook feeds from a diverse panel of participants across the U.S. That data – which excludes personal messages and the users’ actual browsing information – is then anonymized, uploaded to the cloud, and analyzed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the period in question – December 2020 to February 2021 – </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Markup</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s roughly 2,200 panelists’ feeds included 682 flagged posts: that is, posts that were “false, devoid of context, or related to an especially controversial issue.” However, 588 of these were automatic flags pinned on virtually anything election-related. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_40672\" style=\"width: 560px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/flagged-posts.fw_.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-40672\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-40672\" src=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/flagged-posts.fw_.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"154\" srcset=\"https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/flagged-posts.fw_.png 676w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/flagged-posts.fw_-300x84.png 300w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/flagged-posts.fw_-200x56.png 200w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/flagged-posts.fw_-100x28.png 100w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/flagged-posts.fw_-120x34.png 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></a></p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-40672\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Flagged posts seen by the tool over time. Image courtesy of The Markup.</em></p>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of the remaining posts, a measly 12 were explicitly labeled “false,” while 38 were flagged under the far-vaguer label “missing context.” Many posts containing demonstrable lies received non-committal automatic flags urging caution rather than explicit fact-checks, and overall, older Americans and Trump voters were more likely to encounter these weakly flagged posts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The chief flag-ee among the sample was, of course, Donald Trump. However, of the 12 posts that were marked “false,” none belonged to Trump, despite his repeated posts suggesting that President Biden’s win was statistically impossible, illegal, and so on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook, for its part, has argued that it is not its place to “referee political debates and prevent a politician’s speech from reaching its audience.” However, Facebook also claimed that it warned users when they attempted to share flagged content – which, when </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Markup</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tested this functionality, it didn’t. After being asked about this incongruity, Facebook added the warning it had promised.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My guess would be that Facebook doesn’t fact-check Donald Trump not because of a concern for free speech or democracy, but because of a concern for their bottom line,” Ethan Porter, an assistant professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University, told </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Markup</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “They’ve chosen not to aggressively fact-check. As a result, more people believe false things than would otherwise, full stop.” </span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.datanami.com/2021/02/18/analytics-show-facebook-coddling-trumps-falsehoods/\">Analytics Show Facebook Coddling Trump&#8217;s Falsehoods</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.datanami.com\">Datanami</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://www.datanami.com/2021/02/18/analytics-show-facebook-coddling-trumps-falsehoods/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">40629</post-id>\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>\n"},"redirectURL":"","headersSize":-1,"bodySize":84805},"cache":{},"timings":{"blocked":-1,"dns":-1,"connect":-1,"ssl":-1,"send":1.4267999976873398,"wait":274.6913000047207,"receive":61.652399986982346}},{"pageref":"Embarcadero","startedDateTime":"2021-02-23T16:57:18.059-07:00","time":194.84969998896122,"request":{"method":"GET","url":"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/feed/","httpVersion":"HTTP/1.1","cookies":[],"headers":[{"name":"connection","value":"Keep-Alive"},{"name":"cookie","value":"__cfruid=c380f2086cca5447b9e1d48d14751967180543aa-1614124635; uid=lo_1fc4bf97e9f9; __cfduid=d47d2779bf39e49c3c7af6c553cc1dede1614124629"},{"name":"user-agent","value":"Embarcadero URI Client/1.0"},{"name":"host","value":"www.microsoft.com"}],"queryString":[],"headersSize":-1,"bodySize":0},"response":{"status":200,"statusText":"OK","httpVersion":"HTTP/1.1","cookies":[],"headers":[{"name":"content-type","value":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8"},{"name":"x-frame-options","value":"SAMEORIGIN"},{"name":"last-modified","value":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 17:55:24 GMT"},{"name":"link","value":"<https://mssecurity.wpengine.com/wp-json/>; rel=\"https://api.w.org/\""},{"name":"x-xss-protection","value":"1; mode=block"},{"name":"x-content-type-options","value":"nosniff"},{"name":"content-security-policy","value":"upgrade-insecure-requests"},{"name":"x-cacheable","value":"CacheAlways: feed"},{"name":"cache-control","value":"max-age=600, must-revalidate"},{"name":"etag","value":"W/\"9d4682e64ef04f9352f35bb7df765210-gzip\""},{"name":"x-edgeconnect-midmile-rtt","value":"57"},{"name":"x-edgeconnect-origin-mex-latency","value":"9"},{"name":"date","value":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 23:57:16 GMT"},{"name":"transfer-encoding","value":"chunked"},{"name":"connection","value":"keep-alive, Transfer-Encoding"},{"name":"tls_version","value":"tls1.3"},{"name":"strict-transport-security","value":"max-age=31536000"},{"name":"x-rtag","value":"RT"}],"content":{"mimeType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","size":140706,"text":"<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?><rss version=\"2.0\"\n\txmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"\n\txmlns:wfw=\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\"\n\txmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\n\txmlns:atom=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"\n\txmlns:sy=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/\"\n\txmlns:slash=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\"\n\t>\n\n<channel>\n\t<title>Microsoft Security</title>\n\t<atom:link href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/feed/\" rel=\"self\" type=\"application/rss+xml\" />\n\t<link>https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog</link>\n\t<description>Expert coverage of cybersecurity topics</description>\n\t<lastBuildDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 17:55:24 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t<language>en-US</language>\n\t<sy:updatePeriod>\n\thourly\t</sy:updatePeriod>\n\t<sy:updateFrequency>\n\t1\t</sy:updateFrequency>\n\t<generator>https://wordpress.org/?v=5.4.2</generator>\n\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Microsoft listed as a Representative Vendor in 2020 Gartner Market Guide for Insider Risk Management Solutions</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/02/23/microsoft-listed-as-a-representative-vendor-in-2020-gartner-market-guide-for-insider-risk-management-solutions/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Teri Seals-Dormer]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 17:00:40 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Cybersecurity]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/?p=92911</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft listed as a Representative Vendor in the 2020 Market Guide for Insider Risk Management Solutions.

This is a mistake. Insiders often already have access to sensitive data, and the risks, whether malicious or inadvertent, can potentially cause greater damage than external cybersecurity risks.</p>\n<p>Two years ago, after a conversation with our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Bret Arsenault, we embarked upon an incredible journey <a href=\"https://aka.ms/insiderriskblog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">developing Insider Risk Management</a> in Microsoft 365, which organizations could use to identify and manage insider risks.</p>\n<p>In recognition of these investments, I’m excited to announce that Gartner has listed Microsoft as a Representative Vendor in the <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/document/3994931\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2020 Market Guide for Insider Risk Management Solutions</a>. To us, this recognition reinforces our leadership in delivering an innovative solution that allows organizations to quickly identify and collaboratively manage insider risks while maintaining employee privacy.</p>\n<p>According to Gartner, “security and risk management leaders need an insider threat mitigation program that is composed of people, processes and technology.”</p>\n<h2>A few learnings from the report:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The number of incidents has increased by a staggering 47 percent in just two years, from 3,200 in 2018 to 4,700 in 2020.</li>\n<li>Organizations impacted by insider threats spent an average of $11.45 million in 2020—up 31 percent from $8.76 million in 2018.</li>\n<li>More than 60 percent of reported insider threat incidents were the result of a careless employee or contractor, and 23 percent were caused by malicious insiders.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We continue to work closely with our customers to gather feedback to help us build better products.

Analysts estimate that there will be <a href=\"https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252491495/Industrial-IoT-connections-to-reach-37-billion-by-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">37 billion industrial IoT (IIoT) devices by 2025</a>. Even more alarming for business leaders, Gartner predicts that <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-09-01-gartner-predicts-75--of-ceos-will-be-personally-liabl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">75 percent of CEOs will be personally liable for cyber-physical incidents by 2024</a>.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve spent 15 to 20 years adding layers of telemetry and monitoring for IT security. However, most chief information security officers (CISOs) and security operations center (SOC) teams have little or no visibility into their OT risk. It&#8217;s clear that a new approach is needed, one that includes IoT and OT-specific incident response and best practices for bringing the two teams together to defend against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.</p>\n<h2>A changing threat landscape</h2>\n<p>In every area of our lives, cyber-physical systems (CPS) go mostly unseen as they quietly monitor building automation, industrial robots, gas pipelines, HVAC systems, turbines, automated warehousing and logistics systems, and other industrial systems. In the past, OT risk was minimized because of &#8220;air-gapping&#8221; meaning, a physical divide was maintained between OT and IT networks. But digital transformation has disrupted all that. Now devices in the warehouse, refinery, and factory floor are connected directly to corporate IT networks and often to the internet.</p>\n<p>Microsoft offers <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/iot/security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">end-to-end IoT security solutions</a> for new, or &#8220;greenfield,&#8221; IoT deployments, but most of today&#8217;s IoT and OT devices are still considered &#8220;unmanaged&#8221; because they&#8217;re not provisioned, tracked in a configuration management database (CMDB), or consistently monitored. These devices typically don&#8217;t support agents and lack built-in security such as strong credentials and automated patching—making them soft targets for adversaries looking to pivot deeper into corporate networks.</p>\n<p>For OT security, the key priorities are safety and availability. Production facilities need to be up and running to keep generating revenue. However, beyond revenue losses, there&#8217;s a risk for catastrophic damage and possible loss of life when OT systems are breached. And like IT attacks, an OT breach also poses a risk for theft of intellectual property (IP). According to the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), <a href=\"https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/dbir/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">manufacturers are eight times more likely to be breached for theft of IP</a>. OT security translates directly into three main types of business risks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Revenue impact:</strong> In 2017, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WannaCry</a> malware shut down major automotive manufacturers and affected more than 200,000 computers across 150 countries, with damages ranging into billions of dollars. The same year, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NotPetya</a> ransomware nearly shut down the mighty Maersk shipping company and several CPG companies. The attack crippled <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-12-03/merck-cyberattack-s-1-3-billion-question-was-it-an-act-of-war\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Merck&#8217;s production facilities resulting in losses of $1.3 billion</a>. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/lockergoga-ransomware-crippling-industrial-firms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LockerGoga</a> shut down the systems of Norwegian aluminum manufacturing company Norsk Hydro and several other plants. In 2020, <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-is-how-ekans-ransomware-is-targeting-industrial-control-systems/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ekans</a> (snake spelled backward) ransomware became the latest OT threat by specifically shutting down industrial control systems (ICS).</li>\n<li><strong>IP theft:</strong> IP includes proprietary manufacturing processes, formulas, designs, and more. In one instance, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Microsoft Security Response Center</a> (MSRC) discovered hackers were compromising vulnerable IoT devices using their default credentials. Once inside, the hackers scanned the network to see what other systems they could access to get sensitive IP. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/28/1-in-5-companies-say-china-stole-their-ip-within-the-last-year-cnbc.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">One in five</a> North American-based corporations reports that they have had IPs stolen within the last year.</li>\n<li><strong>Safety risks</strong>: The Triton attack on a petrochemical facility targeted safety controllers with the intent to cause major structural damage and possible loss of life. The attackers gained a foothold in the IT network then used living-off-the-land (LOTL) tactics to gain remote access to the OT network, where they deployed their purpose-built malware. As this attack demonstrated, increased connectivity between IT and OT networks gives adversaries new avenues of attack for compromising unmanaged OT devices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The U.S. <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency</a> (CISA) reports that adversaries are still using many of the tactics seen in the Triton cyberattack to compromise embedded devices in OT systems. CISA has issued three basic recommendations for securing OT:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create an up-to-date, detailed inventory and map of your OT network.</li>\n<li>Use the asset inventory or map to prioritize risks, such as unpatched systems, unauthorized connections between subnets, or unauthorized connections to the internet.</li>\n<li>Implement continuous monitoring with anomaly detection.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Azure datacenters—a strategic resource</h2>\n<p>Through our cloud, Microsoft serves more than a billion customers and more than 20 million businesses across 60 regions worldwide. Today we help secure more than <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/01/27/microsoft-surpasses-10-billion-in-security-business-revenue-more-than-40-percent-year-over-year-growth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">400,000 customers across 120 countries</a>. These range from small businesses to large enterprises, with 90 of the Fortune 100 using four or more of our security, compliance, identity, and management solutions. Our SOCs process <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/01/27/microsoft-surpasses-10-billion-in-security-business-revenue-more-than-40-percent-year-over-year-growth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">8 trillion global signals daily</a>. Datacenters are the building blocks of the Cloud, and Microsoft has been building datacenters for more than 30 years. Microsoft datacenters constitute a complex industrial-scale facility sitting at the intersection of operational technologies (OT) and information technologies (IT). This includes industrial control systems managing the climate, power and water, physical security systems, diverse MS and non-MS personnel managing the servers and equipment, various networks including LAN and WAN and WiFi, and diverse software tools. Exclusively leveraging IT security solutions is insufficient to secure datacenters because OT systems have a long lifespan, implement network segregation, rely on proprietary protocols, and patching can disrupt operations leading to safety risks.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-92920 size-full\" src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Data-center-summary-slide-updated.jpg\" alt=\"Infographic showing details about Microsoft datacenters around the world \" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Data-center-summary-slide-updated.jpg 1280w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Data-center-summary-slide-updated-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Data-center-summary-slide-updated-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Data-center-summary-slide-updated-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Data-center-summary-slide-updated-687x385.jpg 687w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Data-center-summary-slide-updated-1083x609.jpg 1083w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Data-center-summary-slide-updated-767x431.jpg 767w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Data-center-summary-slide-updated-539x303.jpg 539w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></p>\n<p><em>Figure 2: Microsoft datacenters.</em></p>\n<p>The biggest risks in securing complex heterogeneous datacenter environments and generations are lack of visibility into the full datacenter stack, and IR plans and playbooks across OT and IT. To address this, we have implemented an end-to-end security monitoring system using Azure Defender for IoT and Azure Sentinel while integrating with Microsoft&#8217;s central SOC.</p>\n<p>To strengthen its data centers&#8217; operational resiliency worldwide, Microsoft&#8217;s Azure data center security team selected <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/01/09/1682657/0/en/CyberX-Receives-U-S-Technology-Patent-for-ICS-Threat-Monitoring-Analytics.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CyberX&#8217;s purpose-built IoT and OT cybersecurity platform</a> in mid-2019. <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/06/22/microsoft-acquires-cyberx-to-accelerate-and-secure-customers-iot-deployments/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Microsoft subsequently acquired CyberX</a> in June 2020 and recently <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/01/27/announcing-the-general-availability-of-azure-defender-for-iot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">released Azure Defender for IoT</a>, which is based on CyberX&#8217;s agentless security platform.</p>\n<p>Incorporating IoT and OT-aware behavioral analytics and threat intelligence, Azure Defender for IoT delivers continuous IoT and OT asset discovery, vulnerability management, and threat detection. As a Network Detection and Response (NDR) platform that uses passive monitoring and Network Traffic Analysis (NTA), it has zero performance impact on the OT network.</p>\n<p>Azure Defender for IoT is now deeply integrated with <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-sentinel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Azure Sentinel</a> and is available for on-premises, Azure-connected, and hybrid environments. By using both Azure Defender for IoT and Azure Sentinel as a unified, end-to-end IT and OT security solution, the Azure datacenter security team has been able to reduce complexity and prevent gaps that can lead to vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-92907\" src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture2-2.png\" alt=\"Microsoft datacenters: Ingestion, detection, and investigation.\" width=\"1133\" height=\"647\" srcset=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture2-2.png 1133w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture2-2-300x171.png 300w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture2-2-1024x585.png 1024w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture2-2-768x439.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1133px) 100vw, 1133px\" /></p>\n<p><em>Figure 3: Microsoft datacenters: Ingestion, detection, and investigation.</em></p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Azure Sentinel processes alert both from IT and OT, including from Azure Defender for IoT for OT devices such as HMIs, PLCs, biometrics, and badge readers and IT devices such as physical hosts, firewalls, virtual machines, routers, and more. All information is integrated with our incident-response system and our central SOC (including OT and IT playbooks) where machine learning reduces false positives and makes our alerts richer—creating a feedback loop with Azure Sentinel, which further refines and improves our alerting capabilities.</p>\n<p>Microsoft datacenter security monitoring and response:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improves the quality of critical environment inventory for risk-based analysis.</li>\n<li>Correlates significant security events across multiple sources.</li>\n<li>Advances detections across industrial control system (ICS) networks for known malware, botnet, and command/control traffic.</li>\n<li>Enables machine learning support for insider threat-detection via user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA).</li>\n<li>Deploys OT and IT incident-response playbooks using Azure Logic Apps integrated with Microsoft SOC. For example, we implement OT and IT playbooks for scenarios like ransomware or malware, botnet, insider threat, and untracked data-bearing devices.</li>\n<li>Detects anomalous activity while reducing noise.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, the Microsoft cloud security stack—<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/itshowcase/microsoft-uses-threat-intelligence-to-protect-detect-and-respond-to-threats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Microsoft Threat Intel Center</a> (MSTIC) is being expanded with OT capabilities and threat intel.</p>\n<h2>OT and IT: Bridging the cultural divide</h2>\n<p>OT and IT have traditionally worked on separate sides of the air gap as laid out in the <a href=\"https://www.automationworld.com/factory/iiot/article/21132891/is-the-purdue-model-still-relevant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Purdue Model</a>. But as I mentioned at the top, that physical divide has vanished into the cloud. Thinking in terms of an IT and OT persona that enables both teams to collaborate seamlessly is the security challenge for our time. Here are a few insights that can help bridge the gap:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mature and boost IT security practices for OT</strong>: Patching an OT system isn&#8217;t the same as updating IT; there can be dangerous repercussions in the form of factory downtime or safety risks. Empathy is important; the liberties enjoyed in the IT world can&#8217;t be blindly applied on OT. However, don&#8217;t throw away IT security best practices—boost them with OT capabilities.</li>\n<li><strong>Embrace the security journey</strong>: Whether you&#8217;re in OT or IT, security improvements move like a dial, not a switch. Agree on your guiding principles and tenants, then constantly improving collaboration between OT and IT teams.</li>\n<li><strong>Understand the OT persona</strong>: IT teams should get to know what a day in the life of an OT person looks like. Our team shadowed OT activity by making site visits, which helped build understanding and establish working relationships.</li>\n<li><strong>Appreciate the other team&#8217;s priorities</strong>: When working with OT, this means understanding the importance of safety and availability. What might be a simple system patch in IT could cause downtime or a safety issue in OT. Establish a common vocabulary and metrics to work out issues together.</li>\n<li><strong>Acknowledge preconceptions</strong>: OT often feels like the IT security approach will cause disruptions and downtime, leading to audits, escalations, or worse. For that reason, our approach became: &#8220;Hey, we found a problem. Let&#8217;s solve it together.&#8221;</li>\n<li><strong>Be proactive versus reactive</strong>: Do security assessments together and keep the right people in the loop. Set up two-way trainings, such as joint tabletop or red team exercises, and plan for &#8220;worst day&#8221; scenarios. Create dedicated websites and SharePoint sites where people can reach out with confidence that their concerns will be addressed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information on securing smart buildings and bridging the IT and OT gap, watch my SANS webinar presentation titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.sans.org/webcasts/securing-building-management-systems-data-centers-ot-security-monitoring-115470\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Securing Building Automation &amp; Data Centers with Continuous OT Security Monitoring</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Learn more</h2>\n<p>To learn more about Microsoft Security solutions, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/solutions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">visit our website</a>. Bookmark the <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Security blog</a> to keep up with our expert coverage on security matters.

After a few months of using and integrating it with our platform here at Expel, we feel the same.</p>\n<p>On Expel’s <a href=\"https://expel.io/blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EXE Blog</a>, we regularly share our thought process on how we think about security operations at scale at Expel and the <a href=\"https://expel.io/blog/spotting-suspicious-logins-at-scale/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">decision support</a> (or additional context) we provide our analysts through automation.</p>\n<p>In short, Defender for Endpoint makes it easy for us to achieve our standard of investigative quality and response time, but it doesn’t require a heavy lift from our analysts. And that’s good news both for our customers and for us.</p>\n<h2>So, what is Microsoft Defender for Endpoint?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/endpoint-defender\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Defender for Endpoint</a> is an enterprise endpoint security product that supports Mac, Linux, and Windows operating systems, along with Android and iOS. There are lots of cool things that Defender for Endpoint does at an administrative level (such as attack surface reduction and configurable remediation). However, from our vantage point, we know it best for its detection and response capabilities.</p>\n<p>Defender for Endpoint is unique because not only does it combine an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and AV detection engine into the same product, but for Windows 10 hosts, this functionality is built into the operating system, removing the need to install an endpoint agent.</p>\n<p>With an appropriate Microsoft license, Defender for Endpoint and Windows 10 provide out-of-the-box protection without the need to mass-deploy software or provision sensors across your fleet.</p>\n<h2>How EDR tools help us as an XDR vendor</h2>\n<p>When we integrate with an EDR product like Defender for Endpoint in support of our customers, our goal is to predict the investigative questions that an analyst will ask and then automate the action of getting the necessary data from that tool.</p>\n<p>This frees up our analysts to make the decision—versus making them spend time extracting the right data.</p>\n<p>We think <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/endpoint-defender\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Defender for Endpoint</a> provides the right toolset that helps us reach that goal—and removes some burden from our analysts—thanks to its APIs.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Defender for Endpoint’s robust APIs, we augmented its capability to provide upfront decision support to our analysts. As a result, we’re able to arm them with the answers to the basic investigative questions we ask ourselves with every alert.</p>\n<p>To find these answers, there are a few specific capabilities of Defender for Endpoint we use that allow us to pull this information into each alert:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advanced hunting database.</li>\n<li>Prevalence information.</li>\n<li>Detailed process logging.</li>\n<li>AV actions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This way, our analysts don’t need to worry about fiddling with the tool but instead focus on analyzing the rich data it provides.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://expel.io/blog/windows-defender-atp-our-two-cents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Check out a real-life example</a> of how Expel analysts use Defender for Endpoint to triage an alert on behalf of a customer.</p>\n<h2>Defender for Endpoint helps reduce our alert-to-fix time</h2>\n<p>The decision support—or additional context about an alert—that Defender for Endpoint enables us to generate is powerful because it allows us to become specialists at analysis rather than specialists of a specific technology.</p>\n<p>Defender for Endpoint provides a platform that allows our analysts to quickly and accurately answer important questions during an investigation.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, though, having these capabilities emulated in the API allowed us to build on top of the Defender for Endpoint platform to be more efficient in providing high-quality detection and response.</p>\n<p>And that’s a win-win for both Expel and our customers.</p>\n<h2>Learn more</h2>\n<p>To learn more about Expel, <a href=\"https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/expel1593100206553.expel?tab=Overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">visit our listing on the Azure Marketplace.</a></p>\n<p>To learn more about the Microsoft Intelligent Security Association (MISA), <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/intelligent-security-association\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">visit our website</a>, where you can learn about the MISA program, product integrations and find MISA members.

We are excited to share that Forrester Consulting has just conducted a commissioned <a href=\"https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RWxD0n\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Total Economic Impact<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> (TEI) study</a> on behalf of Microsoft, which involved interviewing existing customers to create an accessible framework for organizations to evaluate the financial impact of Azure Security Center. The results are big—Azure Security Center delivers 219 percent return on investment (ROI) over three years and a payback of less than six months; reduces the risk of a cloud security breach by up to 25 percent, reduces time to threat mitigation by 50 percent, and reduces the cost of third-party security tools and services from consolidation by over $200,000 annually.</p>\n<p>The Forrester study concluded that Azure Security Center reduces threat protection costs at scale, simplifies security posture management, and improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the Security Operations Center (SOC).</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-92875 size-medium alignleft\" src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture1-2-300x197.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"197\" srcset=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture1-2-300x197.png 300w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture1-2-768x504.png 768w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture1-2-200x130.png 200w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture1-2.png 888w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p>Forrester found that a composite organization experienced benefits of $3.56 million over three years versus costs of $1.1 million. This adds up to an <strong>ROI of 219 percent with payback in less than six months</strong>.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>Cost Savings</h2>\n<p>Prior to using Azure Security Center, the customers were relying on multiple third-party cloud security tools implemented in different organizational siloes to understand their security posture and defend against potential threats. However, the distributed and disintegrated nature of this approach introduced inefficiencies into security workflows, produced a plethora of false-positive threat alerts, and limited visibility of the organization’s overall security posture, leading to potential security risk.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-92876 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture2-1-300x214.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"214\" srcset=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture2-1-300x214.png 300w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture2-1-1024x731.png 1024w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture2-1-768x548.png 768w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture2-1.png 1132w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p>After the investment in Azure Security Center, the customers&#8217; visibility into the security posture of their Azure workloads increased substantially, reducing the risk of cloud security breaches while also improving the productivity of security teams responsible for threat detection and remediation and security policy and regulatory compliance.</p>\n<p>Forrester found that an organization experienced benefits of $3.56 million over three years versus costs of $1.1 million. This adds up to an <strong>ROI of 219 percent with payback in less than six months. </strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;We thought that if we could replace third-party tools with integrated Azure functionality, it might improve visibility. It might catch additional threats. It might ease configuration work, reducing management overhead in the end.&#8221;—</em>IT security manager, professional services ¹</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Reducing risk factors and time to respond</h2>\n<p>Forrester interviewed four customers with experience using Azure Security Center and aggregated the experiences of the interviewed customers, and combined the results into a single composite organization. This framework helps identify the cost, benefit, flexibility, and risk factors that affect the investment decision. According to aggregated data, Azure Security Center demonstrated strong benefits such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reduced risk of a cloud security breach by up to 25 percent.</strong> By improving visibility into an organization&#8217;s security posture across all its Azure workloads and decreasing time to threat remediation, interviewed organizations shared that they were able to reduce the risk of cloud security breaches.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced time to threat mitigation by 50 percent.</strong> Organizations that chose to also deploy Azure Defender within Azure Security Center shared that they were able to decrease their mean time to threat remediation by 50 percent. They were also able to reduce the number of threats needing remediation by 86 percent, thanks to false-positive threat alert reduction. Customers also benefitted from the fact that Microsoft&#8217;s scale and telemetry data enables Azure Security Center to update security recommendations and notify of important threats at speed.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduction in time spent on security policy and compliance management up to 30 percent.</strong> Azure Security Center also reduced the amount of time spent on updating security policies and on compliance-related workflows by between 20 percent and 30 percent. This resulted in the improved productivity of security administrators.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced cost of third-party security tools and services from consolidation by over $200,000 annually.</strong> Customers shared that they reduced their spending and reliance on third-party security tools and services. Customers saved 20 percent to 30 percent on third-party security tools, reduced third-party security services by $180,000, and reduced third-party penetration test services by 50 percent.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced risk of non-compliance.</strong> Customers improved their compliance posture with the added visibility and accessibility of regulatory compliance status through Azure Security Center. They were also able to make recommended fixes to improve compliance they might have otherwise missed.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Whenever we got a vulnerability report, we&#8217;d have a hard time hunting down who was responsible to make sure they would remediate the issue. With Azure Security Center, our teams have full visibility into vulnerabilities, and the recommendations that are applicable to them.&#8221;—</em>Cloud Security Specialist, Retail ¹</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Protect your hybrid cloud workloads today</h2>\n<p>You can start monitoring your security posture for free using Azure Security Center today.

Migration to the cloud and a mobile workforce has dissolved the network boundary and projected the digital estate beyond its traditional confines. Data, users, and systems are everywhere. Additionally, these systems are increasingly domiciled in the cloud and generating a considerable amount of security data. To add to this, on average, companies with over 1,000 employees maintain about 70 security products from 35 different vendors, according to a recent report by CCS Insight. The end result? A vast amount of alerts that security operations center (SOC) teams have to contend with. Unsurprisingly, according to an ESG¹ study, 44 percent of these alerts go uninvestigated due to a combination of talent scarcity and the multiplicity of security solutions generating a huge volume of alerts.</p>\n<p>To help our customers address alert fatigue but still maintain detection efficacy, Microsoft is leveraging the power of Threat Intelligence, native solution integration, AI, and automation to deliver a <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/threat-protection\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unique SIEM and XDR approach</a>—to help tackle the challenge of alert fatigue. But first things first—what exactly are alerts, events, and incidents in the context of security operations? Below is a graphic that will help answer this question before we delve deeper into how Microsoft technology is helping SOC teams sift through high volumes of alerts and narrow down to manageable high-fidelity incidents.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-92863 size-full\" src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture1-1.png\" alt=\"Diagram distinguishing between events, alerts and incidents\" width=\"1678\" height=\"1012\" srcset=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture1-1.png 1678w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture1-1-300x181.png 300w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture1-1-1024x618.png 1024w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture1-1-768x463.png 768w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture1-1-1536x926.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1678px) 100vw, 1678px\" /></p>\n<p>Let us now look at the six strategies that Microsoft employs to help our customers deal with the alert fatigue problem:</p>\n<h2>1. Threat intelligence</h2>\n<p>To combat cyberthreats, Microsoft amalgamates trillions of daily signals, across all clouds and all platforms, for a holistic view of the global security ecosystem. Using the latest in machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques—plus the power of smart humans—we put these signals to work on behalf of our customers taking automated actions when threats are detected, and providing actionable intelligence to security teams when further contextual analysis is required.</p>\n<h2>2. Native integration</h2>\n<p>Microsoft leverages the tight integration across its threat protection solution stack to help customers connect the dots between disparate threat signals and develop incidents by grouping quality alerts from different parts of their environment and stitching together the elements of a threat. First-party security solutions within the Microsoft 365 Defender offering enable our customers to benefit from real-time interactions amongst the tools, backed by insights from the Intelligent Security Graph. As a result, the quality of alerts is improved, false positives are significantly reduced at source, and in some cases, automatic remediation is completed at the threat protection level. Additionally, this can be combined with log data drawn from third-party solutions such as network firewalls and other Microsoft solutions to deliver an end-to-end investigation and remediation experience, as depicted in the image below.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-92865 size-full\" src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture2.png\" alt=\"Image showing integration of Microsoft's XDR offering\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture2.png 800w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture2-300x169.png 300w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture2-768x432.png 768w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture2-687x385.png 687w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture2-767x431.png 767w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture2-539x303.png 539w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<h2>3. Machine learning</h2>\n<p>The third strategy that we employ is the ingestion of billions of signals into our security information and event management (SIEM) solution (Azure Sentinel) then passing those signals through proven machine learning models. Machine Learning is at the heart of what makes Azure Sentinel a game-changer in the SOC, especially in terms of alert fatigue reduction. With Azure Sentinel we are focusing on three machine learning pillars: Fusion, Built-in Machine Learning, and &#8220;Bring your own machine learning.&#8221; Our Fusion technology uses state-of-the-art scalable learning algorithms to correlate millions of lower fidelity anomalous activities into tens of high fidelity incidents. With Fusion, Azure Sentinel can automatically detect multistage attacks by identifying combinations of anomalous behaviors and suspicious activities that are observed at various stages of the kill-chain.</p>\n<p>On the basis of these discoveries, Azure Sentinel generates incidents that would otherwise be difficult to catch. Secondly, with built-in machine learning, we pair years of experience securing Microsoft and other large enterprises with advanced capabilities around techniques such as transferred learning to bring machine learning to the reach of our customers, allowing them to quickly identify threats that would be difficult to find using traditional methods. Thirdly, for organizations with in-house capabilities to build machine learning models, we allow them to bring those into Azure Sentinel to achieve the same end-goal of alert noise reduction in the SOC. Below is a real-life depiction captured within a certain month where machine learning in Azure Sentinel was used effectively to reduce signal noise.</p>\n<h2><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-92879 size-full\" src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture24.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"732\" height=\"367\" srcset=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture24.png 732w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture24-300x150.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px\" /></h2>\n<h2>4. Watchlists</h2>\n<p>Watchlists ensure that alerts with the listed entities are promoted, either by assigning them a higher severity or by alerting only on the entities defined in the watchlist. Among other use-cases, Azure Sentinel leverages Watchlists as a high-fidelity data source that can be used to reduce alert fatigue. For example, this is achieved by creating &#8220;allow&#8221; lists to suppress alerts from a group of users or devices that perform tasks that would normally trigger the alert, thereby preventing benign events from becoming alerts.</p>\n<h2>5. UEBA</h2>\n<p>User and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) is natively built into Azure Sentinel targeting use-cases such as abuse of privileged identities, compromised entities, data exfiltration, and insider threat detection. Azure Sentinel collects logs and alerts from all of its connected data sources, then analyzes them and builds baseline behavioral profiles of your organization&#8217;s entities (users, hosts, IP addresses, applications, and more) across peer groups and time horizons. With the UEBA capability, SOC analysts are now empowered to reduce not just false positives but also false negatives. UEBA achieves this by automatically leveraging contextual and behavioral information from peers and the organization that typical alert rules tend to lack. The image below depicts how UEBA in Azure Sentinel narrows down to only the security-relevant data to improve detection efficiency:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-92866 size-full\" src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture3-1.png\" alt=\"image showing UEBA efficiency funnel\" width=\"797\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture3-1.png 797w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture3-1-300x188.png 300w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture3-1-768x482.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 797px) 100vw, 797px\" /></p>\n<h2>6. Automation</h2>\n<p>The lower tiers of a SOC are typically tasked with triaging alerts, and this is where the critical decisions need to be made as to whether alerts are worth investigating further or not. It is also at this point that automation of well-known tasks that do not require human judgment can have the most significant impact in terms of alert noise reduction. Azure Sentinel leverages Logic Apps native to Azure to build playbooks that automate tasks of varying complexity. Using real-time automation, response teams can significantly reduce their workload by fully automating routine responses to recurring types of alerts, allowing SOC teams to concentrate more on unique alerts, analyzing patterns, or threat hunting. Below is an example of a security playbook that will open a ticket in ServiceNow and send a message to an approver. With a click of a button, if they confirm activity from a malicious IP as a true positive, then automatically that IP is blocked at the firewall level, and the user&#8217;s ID is disabled in Azure Active Directory.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-92867 size-full\" src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture4-1.png\" alt=\"cross-vendor security remediation playbook\" width=\"1680\" height=\"980\" srcset=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture4-1.png 1680w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture4-1-300x175.png 300w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture4-1-1024x597.png 1024w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture4-1-768x448.png 768w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Picture4-1-1536x896.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" /></p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>We have looked at 6 effective strategies that organizations can use to minimize alert fatigue and false positives in the SOC.

In this episode of <a href=\"https://www.podcastone.com/episode/Evaluating-Individual-and-Organizational-Cyber-Risk-in-a-Pandemic-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Afternoon Cyber Tea</a>, James and I talk about how the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the critical need for cooperation across the cybersecurity industry, as well as the need for strengthening communication between governments and private organizations.</p>\n<p>Our discussion really examines how the pandemic has pushed organizations toward greater cost efficiencies and a new mainstreaming of cybersecurity—democratizing the language and tools to make it part of everyone’s “9 to 5” experience.</p>\n<p>“Everyone has a plan until they get hit in the face,” as James puts it. “Ransomware is off the hook—one organization just got hit with a 10 million dollar ransom. That’s more than the average Australian or New Zealand organization spends on security in a year.”</p>\n<p>If the old saying that every crisis presents an opportunity holds true, James sees the pandemic as a tremendous catalyst for better information sharing amid budget cuts and a fragmented workforce. “The security operating centers at large banks are on speed-dial with each other because the attack against Company A hits Company B the next day. No organization, or even an entire country, can do it all by themselves.”</p>\n<p>During our talk, we also touch on how the pandemic has pushed security professionals to look at new ways of optimizing delivery, such as utilizing an <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">integrated security solution</a> rather than an expensive niche product. “It’s given businesses a new appreciation for automatic patching,” James recounts. “My group of CISOs is discussing installing agents on personal devices; the legalities and logistics around that.

In the latest post from our new Voice of the Community blog series, Microsoft Product Marketing Manager <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nataliagodyla/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Natalia Godyla</a> talks with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/davidkennedy4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dave Kennedy</a>, Founder and Chief Technology Officer at <a href=\"https://www.binarydefense.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Binary Defense</a>. Dave shares his insights on security operations—what these teams need to work effectively, best practices for maturing the security operations center (SOC), as well as the biggest security challenges in the years to come.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Natalia: What are the standard tools, roles, frameworks, and services for a security operations team? What are the basic elements a SecOps team needs to succeed?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dave:</strong> Your security operations team must have visibility into your infrastructure, both on and off-premises. Visibility is key because many of these attacks start with one compromised asset or one compromised credential. They spread across the network and in many cases, they wreak a lot of damage. Your endpoints, network infrastructure, and cloud environments are where a lot of these issues happen. I recommend starting with high-risk areas like your endpoints.</p>\n<p>Then, you need somewhere to ingest that data, such as security information and event management systems like <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-sentinel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Microsoft Azure Sentinel</a>, and to go through log analysis and determine if anything has been compromised.</p>\n<p>Also, frameworks like the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework are a great baseline of saying, well, here are specific attacks that we&#8217;ve seen in the wild that are mapped to specific adversaries that are in our industry vertical. That can help you prioritize those, get better at detection, and make sure you have the right logs coming into your environment to build detections.</p>\n<p><strong>Natalia: How can a team operationalize the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dave:</strong> When people first look at the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework, they freak out because it&#8217;s so big, but it&#8217;s a treasure trove of information. Everybody was focused on a castle mentality of being able to protect everything but what happens when an attacker is in your environment? Protection is still very important and you want to have protective mechanisms in place, but protection takes time and requires cultural changes in many cases. If you&#8217;re doing something like <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity/mfa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">multifactor authentication</a>, you have to communicate that to users.</p>\n<p>The MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework tells you what happens when attackers have gotten around your preventive controls. What happens when they execute code onto a system and take other actions that allow them to either extract additional information or move to different systems through lateral movement or post-exploitation scenarios and get access to the data? The MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework is a way to conceptualize exactly what&#8217;s happening from an attacker’s standpoint and to build detections around those attack patterns.</p>\n<p>With the damage we see, it’s usually several hours, days, or months that an attacker has had access to an environment. If we can shave that time down and detect them in the first few minutes or the first few hours of an attack and shut them down, we&#8217;ve saved our company a substantial amount of damage. It&#8217;s a framework to help you understand what&#8217;s happening in your environment and when unusual activities are occurring so you can respond much more effectively.</p>\n<p><strong>Natalia: How much of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework should a security team build into their detections? How much should they rely on existing tools to map the framework?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dave:</strong> Many tools today have already done a lot of mapping to things like the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework, but it&#8217;s not comprehensive. If you have an <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/endpoint-defender\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">endpoint detection and response</a> product, it may cover only 20 percent of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework. Mapping your existing tools and technology to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework is a very common practice. For instance, you may have an email gateway that uses sandboxing virtualization techniques that detonate potential malware to see whether it&#8217;s effective. That’s one component of your technology stack that can help cover certain components of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework. You might have web content filtering that covers a different component of the framework, and then you have endpoint detection and responses (EDRs) that cover a percentage of the endpoint detection pieces.</p>\n<p>Technology products can help you shave away the amount of effort that goes into the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework. It&#8217;s really important, though, that organizations map those out to understand where they have gaps and weaknesses. Maybe they need additional technology for better visibility into their environment. I’m a huge fan of the Windows systems service, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">System Monitor</a> (Sysmon). If you talk to any incident responder, they&#8217;ll tell you that if they have access to Sysmon data logs, that&#8217;s a treasure trove of information from a threat hunting and incident response perspective.</p>\n<p>It’s also important to look at it from an adversary perspective. Not every single adversary in the world wants to target your organization or business. If you’re in manufacturing, for instance, you’re not going to be a target of all adversaries. Look at what the adversaries do and what type of industry vertical they&#8217;re targeting so you don&#8217;t have to do everything in the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework. You can whittle the framework down to what’s important for you and build your detections based on which adversaries are most likely to target your organization.</p>\n<p><strong>Natalia: If a team has all the basics down and wants to mature their SecOps practices, what do you suggest?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dave:</strong> Most <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/06/22/modernizing-security-operations-center-secure-remote-workforce/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">security operations centers</a> are very reactive. Mature organizations are moving toward more proactive hunting or threat hunting. A good example is if you&#8217;re sending all of your logs through Azure Sentinel, you can do things like Kusto Query Language and queries in analysis and data sets to look for unusual activity. These organizations go through command line arguments, service creations, parent-child process relationships, or Markov chaining, where you can look at unusual deviations of parent-child process relationships or unusual network activity.</p>\n<p>It’s a continual progression starting off with the basics and becoming more advanced over time as you run through new emulation criteria or simulation criteria through either red teaming or automation tools. They can help you get good baselines of your environment and look for unusual traffic that may indicate a potential compromise. Adversary emulations are where you&#8217;re imitating a specific adversary attacker through known techniques discovered through data breaches. For example, we look at what happened with the SolarWinds supply chain attack—and kudos to Microsoft for all the research out there—and we say, here are the techniques these specific actors were using, and let&#8217;s build detections off of those so they can&#8217;t use them again.</p>\n<p>More mature organizations already have that in place, and they&#8217;re moving toward what we call <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-and/attack-simulation-training-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365/ba-p/2037291\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">adversary simulation</a>, where you take a look at an organization’s threat models and you build your attacks and techniques off of how those adversaries would operate. You don’t do it by using the same type of techniques that have previously been discovered. You&#8217;re trying to simulate what an attacker would do in an environment and can a blue team identify those.</p>\n<p><strong>Natalia: What are best practices for threat hunting?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dave:</strong> Threat hunting varies based on timing and resources. It doesn&#8217;t mean you have to have dedicated resources. Threat hunting can be an exercise you conduct once a week, once a month, or once a quarter. It involves going through your data and looking for unusual activity. Look at all service creations. Look at all your command line arguments that are being passed. A large percentage of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework can be covered just by parent-child process relationships and command line auditing in the environment. Look at East to West traffic, not just North to South. Look at all your audit logs. Go through Domain Name System (DNS traffic).</p>\n<p>For instance, a user was using Outlook and then clicked on an email that opened an Excel document that triggered a macro that then called PowerShell or CMD EXE. That&#8217;s an unusual activity that you wouldn&#8217;t expect to see from a normal user so let&#8217;s hone in on that and figure out what occurred.</p>\n<p>You can also conduct more purple teaming engagements, where you have a red team launch attacks and detection teams look through the logs at the same time to build better detections or see where you might have gaps in visibility. Companies that have threat hunting teams make it very difficult for red teamers to get around the different landmines that they&#8217;ve laid across the network.</p>\n<p><strong>Natalia: What should an incident response workflow look like?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dave:</strong> An alert or unusual activity during a threat hunting exercise is usually raised to somebody to do an analysis. A SOC analyst typically has between 30 seconds and four minutes per alarm to determine whether the alarm is a false positive or something they need to analyze. Obviously, what stands out are things like obfuscation techniques, such as where you have PowerShell with a bunch of code that looks very unusual and obfuscation to try to evade endpoint protection products. Some of the more confusing ones are things like living off the land, which are attacks that leverage legitimate applications that are code signed by the operating system to download files and execute in the future.</p>\n<p>A research phase kicks off to see what&#8217;s actually going on. If it’s determined that there is malicious activity, usually that&#8217;s when incident response kicks in. How bad is it? Have they moved to other systems? Let&#8217;s get this machine off the network and figure out everything that’s happening. Let&#8217;s do memory analysis. Let&#8217;s figure out who the actual attacker was. Can we combine this with red intelligence and determine the specific adversary? What are their capabilities? You start to build the timeline to ensure that you have all the right data and to determine if it’s a major breach or self-contained to one individual system.</p>\n<p>We ran several incident response scenarios for customers that were impacted by the supply chain attacks on SolarWinds and the biggest challenge for the customers was their logs didn&#8217;t go back that far so it was very difficult for them to say definitively with evidence, that they know what happened.</p>\n<p><strong>Natalia: What does an incident responder need to succeed?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dave:</strong> I&#8217;d strongly recommend doing an incident response readiness assessment for your organization. I also recommend centralized logging—whether that&#8217;s a security information and event management (SIEM) or a data analytics tool or a data lake—that you can comb through. I’m a huge advocate of Sysmon. You can do power execution, command line auditing, DNS traffic, process injection, and parent-child process relationships. I’d also suggest network logs. If you can do full packet captures, which not a lot of organizations can do, that&#8217;s also great. If you can pull data packets coming from a secure sockets layer (SSL) or transport layer security (TLS) and do remote memory acquisition, that&#8217;s also really important. Can we retrieve artifacts from systems in a very consistent way?</p>\n<p>Tabletop exercises can also get executives and IT on the same page about how to handle incidents and work together. Running through very specific types of scenarios can help you figure out where you have gaps or weaknesses. When I was the Chief Security Officer at Diebold, we would run through three to four tabletop exercises a year and include our senior leadership, like our CEO and CFO, twice a year. It was eye-opening for them because they never really understood what goes into incident response and what can happen from a cyber perspective. We’d run through actual simulations and scenarios of very specific attacks and see how they would respond. Those types of scenarios really help build your team’s understanding and determine where you may need better communication, better tooling, or better ways to respond.</p>\n<p><strong>Natalia: What other strategies can security operators implement to try to avoid attacks?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dave:</strong> When you look at layered defense, always improving protection is key. You don&#8217;t want to just focus on detection because you&#8217;re going to be in firefighting mode all the time. The basics really are a big deal: things like multifactor authentication, patch management, and security architecture.</p>\n<p>Reducing the attack surface is important, such as with <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/mfc/reference/application-control?view=msvc-160\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">application control</a> and allowed application lists. Application control is probably one of the most effective ways of shutting down most attacks out there today because you have a good baseline of your organization. That applies very consistently to things like the <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/zero-trust\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zero Trust</a> model. Become more of a service provider for your organization versus providing everything for your organization. Reducing your attack surface will eliminate the noise that incident responders or SOC analysts must deal with and allow them to focus on a lot of the high-fidelity type things that we want to see.</p>\n<p>One of the things that I see continuously going into a lot of organizations is that they&#8217;re just always in firefighting mode, 90 percent of their alarms are false positives, and they’re in alarm fatigue. Their security operations center isn&#8217;t improving on detections. You really need somebody on the strategy side to come in and say: Can we lock our users down in a way that doesn&#8217;t hinder the business, but also lowers the attack surface?</p>\n<p><strong>Natalia: How does vulnerability assessment strategy fit into a SOC strategy?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dave:</strong> Program vulnerabilities and exposures are key opportunities that attackers will use. When we look at historic data breaches, those that use direct exploitation and not phishing were using common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) typically of six months or older that allowed them access to a specific system. That makes it really important to reduce attack surfaces and understand where vulnerabilities are so we can make it a lot more difficult for attackers to get in.</p>\n<p>It’s not a zero-day attack that&#8217;s hitting companies today. It&#8217;s out-of-date systems. It’s not patching appropriately. A lot of companies will do well on the operating system side. They’ll patch their Windows machines, their Linux machines, and Apple. But they fail really hard with the third-party applications and especially the web application tier of the house—middleware, microservices. In almost every case, it comes down to ownership of the application. A lot of times, IT will own the operating system platforms and the infrastructure that it’s on, but business owners typically sponsor those applications and so ownership becomes a very murky area. Is it the business owners that own the updates of the applications or does IT? Make sure you have clear owners in charge of making sure patches go out regularly.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not going through regular <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-defender/#product-overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vulnerability assessments</a> and looking for the vulnerabilities in your environment, you&#8217;re very predisposed to a data breach that attackers would leverage based on missing patches or missing specific security fixes. The first few stages of an attack are the most critical because that&#8217;s where most organizations have built their defenses. In the latter phases of post-exploitation, especially as you get to the exfiltration components, most organizations don&#8217;t have good detection capabilities. It’s really important to have those detection mechanisms in place ahead of time and ensure those systems are patched.</p>\n<p><strong>Natalia: We often discuss the challenges facing security today. Let’s take a different approach. What gives you hope?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dave:</strong> What gives me hope is the shift in security. Ten years ago, we would go into organizations from a penetration testing perspective and just destroy these companies. And then the next year, we&#8217;d go in and we’d destroy these companies again. Their focus was always on the technical vulnerabilities and not on what happens after attackers are in your castle. The industry has really shifted toward the mindset of we have to get better at looking for deviations of patterns of behavior to be able to respond much more effectively. The industry is definitely tracking in the right direction, and that really gives me hope.</p>\n<p>Learn how Microsoft Security solutions can help modernize Security Operations.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Protect hybrid cloud workloads with <a href=\"https://aka.ms/AzureDefender\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Azure Defender</a>.</li>\n<li>Get started with <a href=\"https://aka.ms/AzureSecurityCenter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Azure Security Center</a> now.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To learn more about Microsoft Security solutions <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/solutions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">visit our website</a>.

The latest Microsoft 365 Defender data shows that this trend not only continued, it accelerated: every month from August 2020 to January 2021, we registered an average of 140,000 encounters of these threats on servers, almost double the 77,000 monthly average we <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/02/04/ghost-in-the-shell-investigating-web-shell-attacks/\">saw last year</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-92828\" src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fig1-web-shell-encounters-trend.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"351\" srcset=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fig1-web-shell-encounters-trend.png 750w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fig1-web-shell-encounters-trend-300x150.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Figure 1. Web shell encounters on servers</em></p>\n<p>The escalating prevalence of web shells may be attributed to how simple and effective they can be for attackers. A web shell is typically a small piece of malicious code written in typical web development programming languages (e.g., ASP, PHP, JSP) that attackers implant on web servers to provide remote access and code execution to server functions. Web shells allow attackers to run commands on servers to steal data or use the server as launch pad for other activities like credential theft, lateral movement, deployment of additional payloads, or hands-on-keyboard activity, while allowing attackers to persist in an affected organization.</p>\n<p>As web shells are increasingly more common in attacks, both commodity and targeted, we continue to monitor and investigate this trend to ensure customers are protected. In this blog, we will discuss challenges in detecting web shells, and the Microsoft technologies and investigation tools available today that organizations can use to defend against these threats. We will also share guidance for hardening networks against web shell attacks.</p>\n<h2>Web shells as entry point for attacks</h2>\n<p>Attackers install web shells on servers by taking advantage of security gaps, typically vulnerabilities in web applications, in internet-facing servers. These attackers scan the internet, often using public scanning interfaces like <a href=\"https://www.shodan.io/\">shodan.io</a>, to locate servers to target. They may use previously fixed vulnerabilities that unfortunately remain unpatched in many servers, but they are also known to quickly take advantage of newly disclosed vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>For example, on June 30, F5 Networks released a patch for CVE-2020-5902, a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Traffic Management User Interface (TMUI). The vulnerability is a <a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal\">directory traversal bug</a> with a CVSS score of 9.8 out of a possible 10. Just four days later, on July 4, exploit code was added to a Metasploit module.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-92829\" src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fig2-exploit-code.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"698\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fig2-exploit-code.png 698w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fig2-exploit-code-300x150.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Figure 2. CVE-2020-5902 </em><em>exploit code </em></p>\n<p>The following day, Microsoft researchers started seeing the exploit being used by attackers to upload a web shell to vulnerable servers. The web shell was used to run common cryptocurrency miners. In the days that followed, industry security researchers saw the exploit being broadly used to deploy web shells, with multiple variants surfacing not long after.</p>\n<p>This incident demonstrates the importance of keeping servers up to date and hardened against web shell attacks. Web servers are frequently accessible from the internet and can be used by attackers to gain access to a network.</p>\n<h2>Web shells as persistence mechanisms</h2>\n<p>Once installed on a server, web shells serve as one of the most effective means of persistence in an enterprise. We frequently see cases where web shells are used solely as a persistence mechanism. Web shells guarantee that a backdoor exists in a compromised network, because an attacker leaves a malicious implant after establishing an initial foothold on a server. If left undetected, web shells provide a way for attackers to continue to gather data from and monetize the networks that they have access to.</p>\n<p>Compromise recovery cannot be successful and enduring without locating and removing attacker persistence mechanisms. And while rebuilding a single compromised system is a great solution, restoring existing assets is the only feasible option for many. So, finding and removing all backdoors is a critical aspect of compromise recovery.</p>\n<p>And this brings us back to the challenge of web shell detection. As we mentioned earlier, web shells can be generalized as a means of executing arbitrary attacker input by way of an implant. The first challenge is dealing with just how many ways an attacker can execute code. Web applications support a great array of languages and frameworks and, thus, provide a high degree of flexibility and compatibility that attackers take advantage of.</p>\n<p>In addition, the volume of network traffic plus the usual noise of constant internet attacks means that targeted traffic aimed at a web server can blend right in, making detection of web shells a lot harder and requiring advanced behavior-based detections that can identify and stop malicious activities that hide in plain sight.</p>\n<h2>Challenges in detecting web shells</h2>\n<p>Web shells can be built using any of several languages that are popular with web applications. Within each language, there are several means of executing arbitrary commands and there are multiple means for arbitrary attacker input. Attackers can also hide instructions in the user agent string or any of the parameters that get passed during a web server/client exchange.</p>\n<p>Attackers combine all these options into just a couple of bytes to produce a web shell, for example:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-92830\" src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fig3-web-shell-example-300x291.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"291\" srcset=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fig3-web-shell-example-300x291.png 300w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fig3-web-shell-example.png 560w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Figure 3. Example of web shell code</em></p>\n<p>In the example above, the only readable word in the web shell is “eval”, which can be easy to miss or misinterpret. When analyzing script, it is important to leverage contextual clues. For example, a scheduled task called “Update Google” that downloads and runs code from a suspicious website should be inspected more closely.</p>\n<p>With web shells, analyzing context can be a challenge because the context is not clear until the shell is used. In the following code, the most useful clues are “system” and “cat /etc/passwd”, but they do not appear until the attacker interacts with the web shell:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-92831\" src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fig4-web-shell-example-2-1024x233.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"233\" srcset=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fig4-web-shell-example-2-1024x233.png 1024w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fig4-web-shell-example-2-300x68.png 300w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fig4-web-shell-example-2-768x175.png 768w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fig4-web-shell-example-2.png 1430w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Figure 4. Another example of web shell code</em></p>\n<p>Another challenge in detecting web shells is uncovering intent. A harmless-seeming script can be malicious depending on intent. But when attackers can upload arbitrary input files in the web directory, then they can upload a full-featured web shell that allows arbitrary code execution—which some very simple web shells do.</p>\n<p>These file-upload web shells are simple, lightweight, and easily overlooked because they cannot execute attacker commands on their own. Instead, they can only upload files, such as full-featured web shells, onto web servers. Because of their simplicity, they are difficult to detect and can be dismissed as benign, and so they are often used by attackers for persistence or for early stages of exploitation.</p>\n<p>Finally, attackers are known to hide web shells in non-executable file formats, such as media files. Web servers configured to execute server-side code create additional challenges for detecting web shells, because on a web server, a media file is scanned for server-side execution instructions. Attackers can hide web shell scripts within a photo and upload it to a web server. When this file is loaded and analyzed on a workstation, the photo is harmless. But when a web browser asks a server for this file, malicious code executes server side.</p>\n<p>These challenges in detecting web shells contribute to their increasing popularity as an attack tool. We constantly monitor how these evasive threats are utilized in cyberattacks, and we continue to improve protections. In the next section, we discuss how behavior-based detection technologies help us protect customers from web shell attacks.</p>\n<h2>How Microsoft helps defend networks against web shell attacks</h2>\n<p>Gaining visibility into internet-facing servers is key to detecting and addressing the threat of web shells. To tackle challenges in detecting these threats, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/endpoint-defender\">Microsoft Defender for Endpoint</a> uses a combination of durable protections that prevent web shell installation and behavior-based detections that identify related malicious activity. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint exposes malicious behavior by analyzing script file writes and process executions. Due to the nature of web shells, static analysis is not effective—as we have shown, it is relatively easy to modify web shells and bypass static protections. To effectively deliver protection, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint uses multiple layers of protection through behavior inspection.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/behavioral-blocking-containment\">Behavior-based blocking and containment capabilities</a>, which use engines that specialize in detecting threats by analyzing behavior, monitor web-accessible directories for any new script file creation. While file creation events alone cannot be treated as suspicious, correlating such events with the responsible process tree can yield more reliable signals and surface malicious attempts. The engine can then remediate the script, neutralizing the primary infection vector. For example, IIS instance (<em>w3wp.exe</em>) running suspicious processes such as ‘<em>cmd.exe /c echo’</em>, ‘<em>certutil.exe’</em>, or ‘<em>powershell.exe’</em> that result in the creation of script files in web -accessible folders is a rare event and is, thus, typically a strong sign of web server compromise and web shell installation.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-92834\" src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/a.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"529\" height=\"112\" srcset=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/a.png 529w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/a-300x64.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 529px) 100vw, 529px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-92835\" src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/b.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"399\" height=\"82\" srcset=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/b.png 399w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/b-300x62.png 300w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/b-392x82.png 392w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px\" /></p>\n<p>Microsoft Defender for Endpoint also detects web shell installation attempts originating from remote systems within the organization using various lateral movement methods. For example, attackers have been observed to drop web shells through Windows Remote Management (WinRM) or use existing Windows commands to transfer web shells over SMB. On the web server, these remote actions are carried by system processes, thus giving visibility into the process tree. System privilege process dropping script files is another suspicious event and provides the behavior inspection engines ways to remediate the script before the attackers can perform any malicious actions.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-92836\" src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/c.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"519\" height=\"115\" srcset=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/c.png 519w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/c-300x66.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-92837\" src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/d.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"432\" height=\"61\" srcset=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/d.png 432w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/d-300x42.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px\" /></p>\n<p>Behavior-based protection also provides post-compromise defense in scenarios where attackers are already operating and running commands on web servers. Once attackers gain access to a server, one of their first steps is to understand the privilege and the environment they have access to by using built-in reconnaissance commands that are not typically used by web applications. IIS instance (<em>w3wp.exe</em>) running commands like <em>‘net’</em>, <em>‘whoami’</em>, <em>‘dir’</em>, <em>‘cmd.exe’</em>, or <em>‘query’</em>, to name a few, is typically a strong early indicator of web shell activity.</p>\n<p>IIS servers have built-in management tools used by administrators to perform various maintenance tasks. These platforms surface various PowerShell cmdlets that can expose critical information to the attackers. IIS instances (<em>w3wp.exe</em>) that host various web-facing client services such as Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App or OWA) or Exchange admin center (EAC; formerly known as the Exchange Control Panel or ECP) accessing the management platform or executing below cmdlets is a suspicious activity and signifies a hands-on-keyboard attack. The behavior engine monitors execution of such cmdlets and the responsible process trees, for example:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-92838\" src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/e.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"492\" height=\"295\" srcset=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/e.png 492w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/e-300x180.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px\" /></p>\n<p>With its behavior-based blocking and containment capabilities, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can identify and stop behavior associated with web shell attacks. It raises alerts for these detections, enabling security operations teams to use the rich investigation tools in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to perform additional investigation and hunting for related or similar threats.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-92839\" src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fig5-Microsoft-Defender-alert-web-shell-1a.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1202\" height=\"786\" srcset=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fig5-Microsoft-Defender-alert-web-shell-1a.png 1202w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fig5-Microsoft-Defender-alert-web-shell-1a-300x196.png 300w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fig5-Microsoft-Defender-alert-web-shell-1a-1024x670.png 1024w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fig5-Microsoft-Defender-alert-web-shell-1a-768x502.png 768w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fig5-Microsoft-Defender-alert-web-shell-1a-200x130.png 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1202px) 100vw, 1202px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-92833\" src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fig5-Microsoft-Defender-alert-web-shell-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1211\" height=\"716\" srcset=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fig5-Microsoft-Defender-alert-web-shell-2.png 1211w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fig5-Microsoft-Defender-alert-web-shell-2-300x177.png 300w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fig5-Microsoft-Defender-alert-web-shell-2-1024x605.png 1024w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fig5-Microsoft-Defender-alert-web-shell-2-768x454.png 768w, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fig5-Microsoft-Defender-alert-web-shell-2-440x260.png 440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1211px) 100vw, 1211px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Figure 5.

With script-based malware, however, everything eventually funnels to a few natural chokepoints, such as <em>cmd.exe</em>, <em>powershell.exe</em>, and <em>cscript.exe</em>. As with most attack vectors, prevention is critical.</p>\n<p>Organizations can harden systems against web shell attacks by taking these preventive steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify and remediate vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in web applications and web servers. Use Threat and Vulnerability Management to discover and fix these weaknesses. Deploy the latest security updates as soon as they become available.</li>\n<li>Implement proper segmentation of your perimeter network, such that a compromised web server does not lead to the compromise of the enterprise network.</li>\n<li>Enable antivirus protection on web servers. <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/enable-cloud-protection-windows-defender-antivirus\">Turn on cloud-delivered protection</a> to get the latest defenses against new and emerging threats. Users should only be able to upload files in directories that can be scanned by antivirus and configured to not allow server-side scripting or execution.</li>\n<li>Audit and review logs from web servers frequently. Be aware of all systems you expose directly to the internet.</li>\n<li>Utilize the Windows Defender Firewall, intrusion prevention devices, and your network firewall to prevent command-and-control server communication among endpoints whenever possible, limiting lateral movement, as well as other attack activities.</li>\n<li>Check your perimeter firewall and proxy to restrict unnecessary access to services, including access to services through non-standard ports.</li>\n<li>Practice good credential hygiene. Limit the use of accounts with local or domain admin level privileges.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Web shells and the attacks that they enable are a multi-faceted threat that require comprehensive visibility across domains and platforms. <a href=\"https://aka.ms/m365d\">Microsoft 365 Defender</a> correlates threat data from endpoints, email and data, identities, and apps to coordinate cross-domain protection. <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/microsoft-365-defender\">Learn how you can stop attacks through automated, cross-domain security and built-in AI with Microsoft Defender 365</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Detection and Response Team (DART)</em></p>\n<p><em>Microsoft Defender Security Research Team</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/02/11/web-shell-attacks-continue-to-rise/\">Web shell attacks continue to rise</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/\">Microsoft Security<a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Why threat protection is critical to your Zero Trust security strategy</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/02/08/why-threat-protection-is-critical-to-your-zero-trust-security-strategy/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Lauren Goodwin]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:00:45 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Azure Active Directory]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Azure Security]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Zero Trust]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[CISO]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ciso series page]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/?p=92777</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>The corporate network perimeter has been completely redefined.

As a technical leader, that really caught my attention. The sphere of things I should be able to influence in order to do my job well just grew! </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://wp.proagile.se/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Team-Topologies-book-on-my-desk-1024x641.png\" alt=\"Team Topologies book on my desk with some post-its around it\" class=\"wp-image-6453\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I read that quote in the book “Team Topologies” by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais. I think it’s a really interesting book and introduces several ideas that were new to me at least. They deserve a wide audience within the software industry. In this article I’ll give you some highlights, and hopefully tempt you to read the book for yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This first idea perhaps isn’t so novel, but it is the basis for the rest, so worth mentioning first. You should use the&nbsp;<strong>team</strong>&nbsp;as the fundamental building block for your organization. Rather than thinking about hierarchies or departments that get re-organized from time to time, think about building close-knit, long-lived teams. Adopt a team structure that is aligned to the business and adapts and evolves over time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Conway’s law</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When designing a team structure for your organization you should take into account Conway’s law. Your team structure and your software architecture are strongly linked. You should&nbsp;<em>design</em>&nbsp;team responsibilities and communication pathways. Skelton and Pais suggest there are four fundamental team topologies, ie kinds of team. The main one is ‘business stream-aligned’, the other three have supporting roles. The way they describe a stream-aligned team seems familiar to me. It’s like a DevOps team or a feature team. I think the name is better though. It’s a team that’s aligned to a single, valuable stream of work. They do everything needed to deliver valuable software to customers, gather feedback from how it’s used, and improve the way they work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other three kinds of team exist to reduce the burden on those stream-aligned teams. Skelton and Pais introduce the idea that good organization design requires restricting the amount of ‘cognitive load’ each team is expected to handle. Software systems can become large and complex and can require an overwhelming amount of detailed knowledge to work on them. This really resonated with me. I’ve worked on teams where the amount of software we had to look after was just too much to cope with. Important work was delayed or missed because we were overburdened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other three types of team are:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Platform&nbsp;</li><li>Complicated Subsystem</li><li>Enabling</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a fuller description of each in the book of course, but to summarize – platform teams provide a self-service tool, API or software service. Enabling teams support other teams with specialized knowledge in particular techniques and business domains. Complicated subsystem teams look after a particular component of the software that needs specialized knowledge, like an optimizer or a machine learning algorithm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following from the idea of Conway’s law in particular, is the idea that you should have only three ‘interaction modes’ between teams. Restrict the communication pathways to get the architecture you want, and to avoid unnecessary team cognitive load. Skelton and Pais suggest teams should work together in one of three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Collaborate</li><li>Facilitate</li><li>Provide X-as-a-Service</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Collaboration means two teams work closely together, have a common goal, and only need to work this closely for a limited time. (Otherwise the teams would merge!) Facilitation is about one team clearing impediments that are holding back the other team. X-as-a-service is a much looser collaboration, where one team provides something like a software library or api to another team. The way teams interact with one another will evolve over time, and consequently your organization will also evolve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I thought it was a good sign that I could imagine how my own work would fit into an organization designed this way. I think I would fit well into an Enabling team that would support stream-aligned teams through facilitation. We would work with several teams over time. My particular role is to facilitate a team to clear impediments around technical debt and code quality, and learn skills like Test-Driven Development.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Team Topologies really does make organizational design feel like you’re doing architecture. Skelton and Pais have pretty diagrams throughout their book with colours and patterns and lines and boxes describing various organizational designs. It’s all very attractive to a software developer like me. I think the intended audience is managers though. People who are designing organizations today. I really hope some of them read this book and are inspired to involve technical people in important organizational decisions.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2020/10/team-topologies-review/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>1</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">662</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Can you do Behaviour Driven Development with Approval Tests?</title>\n\t\t<link>http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2020/08/behaviour-driven-development-with-approval-tests/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Emily Bache]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 11 Aug 2020 14:29:57 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[agile]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Approval Testing]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[ATDD]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[BDD]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/?p=655</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[In BDD you discover what software you should build through a collaborative process involving both software developers and business people.

BDD also involves a lot of test automation and tools like Cucumber and SpecFlow. But what would happen if you used an Approval testing tool instead? Would that still be BDD?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://wp.proagile.se/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2019-12-18-at-14.45.59.png\" alt=\"Double-loop TDD diagram.

I think it’s an excellent way for teams to gain a good understanding of what the end-user wants and how they will use the software. I like the emphasis on whole team collaboration and building shared understanding through examples. These examples can be turned into executable scenarios, also known as acceptance tests. They then become ‘living documentation’ that stays in sync with the system and helps everyone to collaborate over the lifetime of the software.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wrote&nbsp;<a href=\"http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2013/04/outside-in-development-with-double-loop-tdd/\">an article</a>&nbsp;about Double-Loop TDD a while back, and I was thinking about BDD again recently in the context of Approval testing. Are they compatible? The usual tools for automating scenarios as tests are SpecFlow and Cucumber which both use the Gherkin syntax. Test cases comprise ‘Given-When-Then’ steps written in natural language and backed up by automation code. My question is – could you use an Approval testing tool instead?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I recently read a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bddbooks.com/\">couple of books</a>&nbsp;by Nagy and Rose. They are about BDD and specifically how to discover good examples and then formulate them into test cases. I thought the books did a good job of clearly explaining these aspects in a way that made them accessible to everyone, not just programmers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nagy and Rose are planning a third book in the series which will be more technical and go into more detail on how to implement the automation. They say that you can use other test frameworks, but in their books they deal exclusively with the Gherkin format and Cucumber family of tools. What would happen if you used an Approval testing tool? Would it still be BDD or would we be doing something else? Let’s go into a little more detail about the key aspects of BDD: discovery, formulation, and automation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Discovery</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The discovery part of BDD is all about developers talking with business stakeholders about what software to build. Through a structured conversation you identify rules and examples and unanswered questions. You can use an ‘example mapping’ workshop for that discussion outlined in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cucumber.io/blog/bdd/example-mapping-introduction/\">this blog post</a>&nbsp;by Cucumber Co-founder, Matt Wynne.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Formulation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The formulation part of BDD is about turning those rules and examples of system behaviour into descriptive scenarios. Each scenario is made as intelligible as possible for business people, consistent with the other scenarios, and unambiguous about system behaviour. There’s a lot of skill involved in doing this!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Automation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The automation part of BDD is where you turn formulated scenarios into executable test cases. Even though the automation is done in a programming language, the focus is still on collaboration with the business stakeholders. Everyone is expected to be able to read and understand these executable scenarios even if they can’t read a programming language.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Double-Loop TDD</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The picture shown at the start of the article from Nagy and Rose’s Discovery BDD book emphasizes the double loop nature of the BDD automation cycle. The outer loop is about building the supporting code needed to make a formulated scenario executable. Test-Driven Development fits within it as the inner loop for implementing the system that fulfills the scenarios. In my experience the inner loop of unit tests goes round within minutes, whereas the outer loop can take hours or even days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later in the book they have a more detailed diagram showing an example BDD process:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://wp.proagile.se/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-08-at-11.00.23-1024x660.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6436\"/><figcaption><br>Figure 16 &nbsp;from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://leanpub.com/bddbooks-discovery\">“Discovery – Explore behaviour using examples” by Gaspar Nagy and Seb Rose</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This diagram is more complex, so I’m not going to explain it in depth here (for a deep dive take a look at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/bdd-tasks-activities-seb-rose/\">this blog post</a>&nbsp;by Seb Rose, or of course read the book itself!). What I want to point out is that the ‘Develop’ and ‘Implement’ parts of this diagram are showing double-loop TDD again, with slightly more detail than before. For the purpose of comparing a BDD process, with and without Approval testing, I’ve redrawn the diagram to emphasize those parts:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://wp.proagile.se/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/BDD_Nagy_Rose.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6437\" width=\"447\" height=\"359\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>How you formulate, automate, and implement with TDD will all be affected by an approval testing approach. I recently wrote an article ”<a href=\"https://proagile.se/blog/develop-new-features-approval-testing\">How to develop new features with Approval Testing, Illustrated with the Lift Kata</a>”. That article goes through a couple of scenarios, how I formulate them as sketches, then automate them with an approval testing tool. Based on the process described in that article I could draw it like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://wp.proagile.se/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Approvals-BDD-Sketch.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6438\" width=\"419\" height=\"346\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s different?</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>“Formulate” is called “Sketch” since the method of formulation is visual rather than ‘Given-When-Then’. The purpose is the same though.</li><li>“Automate” includes writing a Printer as well as the usual kind of ‘glue’ code to access functionality in your application. A Printer can print the state of the software system in a format that matches the Sketch. The printer code will also evolve as you work on the implementation.</li><li>“Implement” is a slightly modified TDD cycle. With approval tests you still work test-driven and you still refactor frequently, but other aspects may differ. You may improve the Printer and approve the output many times before being ready to show the golden master to others for review.</li><li>“Review” – this activity is supposed to ensure the executable scenario is suitable to use as living documentation, and that business people can read it. The difference here is that the artifact being reviewed is the Approved Golden Master output, not the sketch you made in the “Formulate” activity. It’s particularly important to make sure business people are involved here because the living documentation that will be kept is a different artifact from the scenario they co-created in the ‘discover’ activities.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>But is this still BDD?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m happy to report that, yes, this is still BDD! I hope you can see the activities are not that different. Just as importantly, the BDD community is open and welcoming of diversity of practice.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cucumber.io/blog/bdd/bdd-is-a-centered-rather-than-a-bounded-community/\">This article</a>&nbsp;describes BDD practitioners as forming a ‘centered’ community rather than a bounded community. That means people are open to you varying the exact practices and processes of BDD so long as you uphold some common values. The really central part of BDD is the collaborative discovery process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article I hope I’ve shown that using an approval testing approach upholds that collaborative discovery process. It modifies the way you do formulation, automation, and development, but in a way that retains the iterative, collaborative heart of BDD. For some kinds of system sketches and golden masters might prove to be easier for business people to understand than the more mainstream ‘Given-When-Then’ Gherkin format. In that case an approval testing tool might enable a better collaborative discovery process and propel you closer to the centre of BDD.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>BDD is about a lot more than test automation, and Gherkin is not the only syntax you can use for that part. Approval testing is perfectly compatible with BDD. I’m happy I can both claim to be a member of the BDD community&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;continue to choose a testing tool that fits the context I’m working in. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />&nbsp;<br>If you’d like to learn more about Approval testing check out&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/dJl5FLOp5Hw\">this video</a>&nbsp;of me pair programming with Adrian Bolboaca.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">655</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>How to develop new features with Approval Testing Illustrated with the Lift Kata</title>\n\t\t<link>http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2020/04/how-to-develop-new-features-with-approval-testing-illustrated-with-the-lift-kata/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Emily Bache]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 07:34:10 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Code Kata]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[BDD]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[TDD]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/?p=652</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[It’s Test-Driven Development with a twist!

Developing new functionality with approval tests requires some slightly different steps, but if you’re a visual thinker like me you might just prefer it. In this blog post I’ll explain how it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://wp.proagile.se/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/jason-dent-YXZM_NSGf90-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@jdent?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Jason Dent</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/elevator?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You may be familiar with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata\">Gilded Rose Kata</a>. It’s the most popular exercise I have on my GitHub page. About a year ago I posted&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.praqma.com/stories/advanced-testing-refactoring-techniques/\">some videos</a>&nbsp;demonstrating a way to solve it. I used several techniques, including ‘Approval’ testing, which is also known as ‘Golden Master’ testing. It’s an approach that’s often used to get legacy code under control. What’s perhaps less known is that you can use the same tools for new development. I’ve put together a new exercise – the ‘Lift’ kata – to help people understand how this works.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve never done the Lift Kata now might be a good time to try it out. I originally worked from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://kata-log.rocks/lift-kata\">this description</a>&nbsp;of it, and I now have my&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/emilybache/Lift-Kata\">own description and GitHub repo</a>&nbsp;for those who want to try it out “approval testing style”. The first step towards solving it is to spend some time understanding the problem. I’m going to assume that most of you have been in a lift at some point, so take a few minutes to note down your understanding of how they work, and the rules that govern them. Perhaps even formulate some test cases.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did this by sketching out some scenarios. I say ‘sketch’ and not ‘formulate’ quite deliberately! The way my mind works is quite visual, so for me it made sense to represent each floor vertically on the page, and write the name of the lift next to the floor it was on. This shows a lift system with four floors named 0, 1, 2, 3, and one lift named ‘A’, on floor 0:<br></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://wp.proagile.se/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/lift1-1.png\" alt=\"sketch of one lift on floor 0\" class=\"wp-image-6398\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is just a snapshot of a moment in time. I then started to think about how a lift responds to people pressing the floor buttons inside. I figured that this is an important aspect to test and proceeded to sketch it out. It occurred to me that I could write a list of requested floor numbers next to the lift name, but then I noticed it was even clearer if I put a mark next to each requested. For example, if passengers request floors 2 and 3 I can sketch it like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://wp.proagile.se/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/lift2.png\" alt=\"sketch of lift on floor 0 with requests to go to floor 2 and 3\" class=\"wp-image-6399\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The next move for this lift would be to go to floor 2 since it’s the closest requested floor. That example could be formulated as a test case sketch like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://wp.proagile.se/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/lift3.png\" alt=\"sketch of lift on floor 0 moving to floor 2\" class=\"wp-image-6400\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I can use this sketch as the first test case for TDD. I’ll need to write code for a lift with floors and requests. I’ll also need to write a ‘Printer’ that can turn a lift object into some output that looks like my sketch. I write some code for this and use the printer output in the ‘verify’ step of the test. After some work the output looks like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://wp.proagile.se/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2019-12-17-at-09.57.00.png\" alt=\"ascii printout from my test showing lift moving from floor 0 to floor 2\" class=\"wp-image-6389\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This ascii-art looks much the same as my sketch. One difference is that I wrote the floor numbers at both ends of each line. This is a trick to stop my editor from deleting what it thinks is irrelevant trailing whitespace at the ends of lines! I think it looks enough like my sketch to approve the output and store it as a ‘golden master’ for this scenario. Actually, I’ve already approved it several times as it started to look more and more like my sketch. And every time I did that I could refactor a little before adding more functionality and updating the approved file again.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m looking at the requirements again and realize that I haven’t modelled the lift’s doors. You can’t fulfill a request until you’ve opened the doors, and that only happens after you’ve moved to the right floor. I drew a new sketch including them, shown below. I’ve written [A] for a lift called ‘A’ with closed doors, and ]A[ for when it has open doors. I also show an intermediate step when the lift is on the correct floor, but since the doors are closed the request is still active:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://wp.proagile.se/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/lift4.png\" alt=\"sketch of lift moving from floor 0 to floor 2 and opening the doors\" class=\"wp-image-6401\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To get this to pass I’ll need to update all of my lift class, my printer, and my test case. After a little coding, and a few iterations of improving both the code and the printer, the test produces output that looks like this and I approve it:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://wp.proagile.se/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2019-12-17-at-09.53.42.png\" alt=\"ascii printout of lift moving from floor 0 to 2 and opening the doors\" class=\"wp-image-6391\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that the test is passing, I’m fairly happy that my lift can answer requests. The next feature I was thinking about was being able to call the lift from another floor. For this I think I’ll need a new test case. Let’s say I’m standing on the third floor and the lift is on floor 1, and I press the button to go down. I can include that in my sketch by putting a ”v” next to the floor I’m on. The whole scenario might play out like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://wp.proagile.se/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/lift5.png\" alt=\"sketch of lift on floor 1 being called to floor 3, moving there and opening the doors\" class=\"wp-image-6402\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As before, I spend time improving both the lift code and the printer. I approve intermediate results several times and do several refactorings. At some point the output from my program looks like my sketch and I approve it:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://wp.proagile.se/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2019-12-18-at-11.20.45.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6393\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Great stuff! My lift can now fulfill requests from passengers and answer calls from another floor. Time for a celebratory cup of tea!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve shown you the first couple of test cases, but there are of course plenty more features I could implement. A system with more than one lift for a start. Plus, the lift should alert the person waiting when it arrives by making a ‘ding’ when it opens the doors. I feel my lifts would be vastly improved if they said ding! I’ll have to come up with a new sketch that includes this feature. For the moment, let’s pause and reflect on the development process I’ve used so far.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Comparing Approval Testing with ordinary TDD</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If I’d been doing ordinary Test-Driven Development with unit tests I might have created a dozen tests in the same time period for the same functionality. With Approval Testing I’ve still been working incrementally and iteratively and refactoring just as frequently. I only have two test cases though. The size of the unit being tested is a little larger than with ordinary TDD, but the feedback cycle is similarly short.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a slightly larger unit for testing can be an advantage or a disadvantage, depending on how you view it. When the chunk of code being tested is larger, and the test uses a fairly narrow interface to access that code, it constrains the design less than it would if you instead had many finer grained tests for lower level interfaces. That means the tests don’t influence the design as strongly, and don’t need to be changed as often when you refactor.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another difference is that I’ve invested some effort in building code that can print a lift system as an ASCII artwork, which is reused in all my tests. In classic TDD I’d have had to write assertion code that would have been different in every test.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Try it for yourself</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>What I’ve done isn’t exactly the same as ordinary TDD, but I think it’s a useful approach with many of the same benefits. I’ve put this exercise up on GitHub, so you can try it out for yourself. I’ve included the code for my printer so you don’t have to spend a lot of time setting that up, and can get on with developing your lift functionality. I’ve also recorded&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/LxktYWh05Uk\">a video together with Adrian Bolboaca</a>&nbsp;where I explain how the exercise works. So far I’ve translated the starting code into Java, C# and Python, and some friends have done a C++ version. (Do send me a pull request if you translate it to your favourite language.) And that’s it! You’ve seen how easy it is, so why don’t you have a try at Approval testing-style TDD for yourself?</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">652</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Three Signs You Need Technical Agile Coaching</title>\n\t\t<link>http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2020/02/three-signs-you-need-technical-agile-coaching/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Emily Bache]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 29 Feb 2020 14:40:59 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Coding Skills]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[agile]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[TDD]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/?p=649</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[How your team actually writes its code is very important if your organization is trying to build products in an Agile way.

This post considers the risks associated with insufficiently Agile coding practices and explains how to identify them before they become major issues.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://wp.proagile.se/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/two-women-looking-at-the-code-at-laptop-1181263-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6360\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly every software organization has high ambitions for increasing their agility and yours is probably one of them. It’s common to bring in experienced coaches to help teams operate with more agility and to discover ways of delivering more value. But, if you’re working on software products, you’ll find it’s hard to realize some of the benefits of Agile without changing the behaviour of developers in the codebase. Too many coaching efforts place little or no emphasis there.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Agile Coaching helps your business to become more successful by improving the way you plan and deliver software.&nbsp;<em>Technical&nbsp;</em>Agile Coaching specifically focuses on how people write code. How do you know if you need Technical Agile Coaching? Here are three signs.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>You spend more time fixing bugs than building new features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>L</strong>ook at all the tasks you work on each week. Ask yourself how much time is being spent on innovative new features, and how much on fixing defects in existing features? For some teams the answer can be as little as 5% of time spent on proactive new work. Now ask yourself – how much more money would our organization make if we spent less time on fixes and more on delivering new features?&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turning this situation around is about increasing the quality of your work so that fewer fixes are needed, resulting in more time for innovation. Often, the root cause of defects is technical debt and code that is hard to understand and change.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can mitigate against this by training your developers to build in quality from the start. Technical Agile Coaching helps teams to improve automated tests and reduce technical debt by demonstrating various techniques and practices for evolving design safely.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Delivery of new features is delayed, sometimes more than once</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Are your new features around 80% done for long periods and then take forever to be actually ready for release? Often this is the biggest complaint from customers and other stakeholders. How much would it be worth to your organization for new functionality to be available reliably and on time?&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Late deliveries are often caused by developers not collaborating effectively in the code. To build a new feature they need to bring the whole team’s expertise to bear, and integrate their work seamlessly. Typically, the coding work is not divided up in a way that makes collaboration easy, and changes are not integrated until late in the process.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technical Agile Coaching helps developers to deliver on time: reliable automated regression tests promote better collaboration with a shared view of the current status; teams learn to divide up the coding work and integrate changes far more frequently than the interval between external deliveries; developers learn to use their tools better and to communicate effectively within the team so they can complete tasks more reliably.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Developers complain the code is so bad they need to re-write the whole thing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes developers ask for a hiatus in new feature development for several months, even a year, so they can start over by rebuilding the same functionality using new tools and frameworks. This is a significant cost to your business, and a large risk. A more staged approach carries far less risk and allows you to build&nbsp;<em>better</em>&nbsp;functionality with much more manageable cost.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually, an organization arrives in this situation after many years of accumulated technical debt. The technologies chosen originally become outdated and are not upgraded in a timely way. Developers make design decisions and then leave without fully documenting or otherwise transferring design knowledge to new team members. New features are added that were not anticipated in the original design. Gradually the code quality declines and it becomes harder and harder to work with.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technical Agile Coaching helps developers gain better control over existing code, so they can continue working with it and building new features. Teams learn to migrate code to newer technologies in a series of smaller, less risky steps, adding new functionality as they go. Developers learn to pay off technical debt and to communicate better about design decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Benefits of Technical Agile Coaching</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Technical Agile Coaching helps developers to change the way they work, day to day, minute by minute, in their codebase. They learn to increase the quality of the code in their product and work more effectively as a team. The coach works closely with the developers while they are writing code to remind, reinforce, teach, and demonstrate Agile practices. With Technical Agile Coaching you should expect to see the following benefits:<br></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Reductions in technical debt</li><li>Better automated regression tests</li><li>Improved communication between developers within the team</li><li>Smaller, safer changes integrated often and documented well</li><li>Improved effectiveness using team development tools and IDEs.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Technical Agile Coaching helps a team to improve how they write code, and begin to use more effective agile development practices together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>If you’re interested in getting some Technical Agile Coaching, please&nbsp;<a href=\"https://proagile.se/kontakta-oss/\">contact us</a>&nbsp;at ProAgile.

Last week my colleague <a href=\"https://proagile.se/blog/medarbetare/fredrik-wendt\">Fredrik Wendt</a> and I facilitated and hosted a Code Retreat event for a diverse group of software crafters from local companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://wp.proagile.se/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/whole_group_start-1024x492.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6325\"/><figcaption>at the start of the day</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s the 10th anniversary of the “<a href=\"https://www.coderetreat.org/\">Global Day of Code Retreat</a>” event and there were over 150 locations around the globe holding one last week. It’s not the first time I’ve facilitated a Code Retreat but it is the first time I’ve done one in Gothenburg, (the others have been in Stockholm). This year Fredrik and I were keen to bring together some local people, and contribute to the community here. ProAgile has recently invested in a fantastic venue for courses and training at our offices, and we want to take full advantage of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We contacted several local companies and specifically invited them to advertise on the event sign up page that they were going to send people. We were delighted when&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ww2.jeppesen.com/\">Boeing (Jeppesen)</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pagero.se/\">Pagero</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.meltwater.com/se/\">Meltwater</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.spotify.com/se/\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.greenbyte.com/\">Greenbyte</a>&nbsp;all agreed to this. Their intention to participate I’m sure helped get the attention of other local software crafters when we put out a general invitation with open sign-ups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end we were a very diverse group drawn from many local companies both large and small. We had a game designer who favoured C++, a Scala enthusiast, a Kotlin proponent, a Python trainer, several Javascript developers, a self-taught PHP and Python developer, a CEO who still codes occasionally, and many local Java, Python and C# developers. Everyone got to pair program with people from other language communities and backgrounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fredrik and I decided to hold a standard code retreat event and based our planning on this article: “<a href=\"https://www.coderetreat.org/pages/facilitating/structure-of-a-coderetreat/\">Structure of a Code Retreat</a>”. We held 5 sessions working on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://codingdojo.org/kata/GameOfLife/\">“Game of Life” Code Kata</a>&nbsp;through the day. In each session, people work in pairs starting from an empty editor, and come up with a new solution to the problem. Between each session you hold a short retrospective with your pairing partner before taking a short break and switching to a different pairing partner.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://wp.proagile.se/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_9650-1-1024x551.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6328\"/><figcaption>pair programming</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the morning sessions the focus is on getting to know the problem. We all try to find a good way to use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development\">Test-Driven Development</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?XpSimplicityRules\">simple design rules</a>&nbsp;to get a clean, understandable, flexible design. The sessions after lunch are about using this Game of Life exercise as a vehicle for trying out something new or otherwise challenging. We had some pairs using unfamiliar programming languages and environments. Some pairs were following strict design rules like ‘no if statements, no loops’ and ‘no function longer than 1 line’. Some people accepted the challenge to work on the problem as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming\">mob</a>; we were 4-6 people using one computer with me facilitating.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://wp.proagile.se/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_9646-1024x553.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6329\"/><figcaption>mob programming</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the day there were opportunities to reflect on the way we write code: how design guidelines and programming languages and Test-Driven Development and personal preferences all interact to influence the code we end up with. In normal project work with deadlines and tricky business rules and security constraints and so on, you might not get much time to consider the fundamentals of what good software design looks like. Test-Driven Development is a complex skill to learn – it has many facets. I think all programmers benefit from taking some time occasionally to work on practice exercises and discuss software design principles with peers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the day we reflected all together in a closing circle. Everyone had the opportunity to say a few words to the group about what they were taking away with them. When you’ve spent time working on a Code Kata, I think there is a complexity gap you need to bridge – you want to carry over the principles and skills you gained from that simple exercise to your actual production code situation. It’s useful to think about what you’ve learnt and explain how you want to apply it later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the closing circle, I was happy to hear several positive comments about Test-Driven Development and an intention to use it more. Some people had seen a new programming language and had ideas about when it could be useful to them. Several people mentioned they appreciated the chance to program with people outside of their company and comfort zone. It was a good day, and I don’t think it will be the last such event we hold in Gothenburg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’d like to know about the next events hosted by ProAgile, take a look at our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://proagile.se/vara-kurser/\">course calendar</a>, keep an eye on ProAgile’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/10244992\">social media</a>&nbsp;channels and perhaps join one of our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://proagile.se/lar-mer/\">networking groups</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://wp.proagile.se/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_9657-1024x482.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6326\"/><figcaption>whole group at the end</figcaption></figure>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">646</post-id>\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>\n"},"redirectURL":"","headersSize":-1,"bodySize":44361},"cache":{},"timings":{"blocked":-1,"dns":-1,"connect":-1,"ssl":-1,"send":1.5183999985456467,"wait":896.5802000015974,"receive":366.69699999690056}},{"pageref":"Embarcadero","startedDateTime":"2021-02-23T16:57:19.634-07:00","time":200.21499998867512,"request":{"method":"GET","url":"https://blog.risingstack.com/rss/","httpVersion":"HTTP/1.1","cookies":[],"headers":[{"name":"connection","value":"Keep-Alive"},{"name":"cookie","value":"__cfruid=c380f2086cca5447b9e1d48d14751967180543aa-1614124635; uid=lo_1fc4bf97e9f9; __cfduid=d47d2779bf39e49c3c7af6c553cc1dede1614124629"},{"name":"user-agent","value":"Embarcadero URI Client/1.0"},{"name":"host","value":"blog.risingstack.com"}],"queryString":[],"headersSize":-1,"bodySize":0},"response":{"status":200,"statusText":"OK","httpVersion":"HTTP/1.1","cookies":[],"headers":[{"name":"date","value":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 23:57:18 GMT"},{"name":"content-type","value":"text/xml; charset=utf-8"},{"name":"transfer-encoding","value":"chunked"},{"name":"connection","value":"keep-alive"},{"name":"x-powered-by","value":"Express"},{"name":"cache-control","value":"public, max-age=14400"},{"name":"etag","value":"W/\"61162-YryIWqEdzYHC2Wc9CUtxiv337cQ\""},{"name":"vary","value":"Accept-Encoding"},{"name":"cf-cache-status","value":"HIT"},{"name":"age","value":"12379"},{"name":"cf-request-id","value":"0872ec77f0000039d70d377000000001"},{"name":"expect-ct","value":"max-age=604800, report-uri=\"https://report-uri.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/beacon/expect-ct\""},{"name":"report-to","value":"{\"endpoints\":[{\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/a.nel.cloudflare.com\\/report?s=9S8ORmxKz4XiLObSo9tikqzPYgqzCCZaKhfnh%2ByLwgk7l6lIZA%2Bse5lzQkp3D0sW95o5mUN2EbBO%2BliumQrWQocmLmHbEU%2FSuThqJSJuzHPr1zgcmQ%3D%3D\"}],\"max_age\":604800,\"group\":\"cf-nel\"}"},{"name":"nel","value":"{\"max_age\":604800,\"report_to\":\"cf-nel\"}"},{"name":"server","value":"cloudflare"},{"name":"cf-ray","value":"6264e36cb9ea39d7-SEA"}],"content":{"mimeType":"text/xml; charset=utf-8","size":397666,"text":"<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?><rss xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\" xmlns:atom=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\" version=\"2.0\" xmlns:media=\"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/\"><channel><title><![CDATA[RisingStack Engineering - Node.js Tutorials & Resources]]></title><description><![CDATA[Learn about Node.js, JavaScript & Mircoservices from the experts of RisingStack.]]></description><link>https://blog.risingstack.com/</link><image><url>https://blog.risingstack.com/favicon.png</url><title>RisingStack Engineering - Node.js Tutorials &amp; Resources</title><link>https://blog.risingstack.com/</link></image><generator>Ghost 2.18</generator><lastBuildDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2021 16:28:41 GMT</lastBuildDate><atom:link href=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/rss/\" rel=\"self\" type=\"application/rss+xml\"/><ttl>60</ttl><item><title><![CDATA[Building a Real-Time Webapp with Node.js and Socket.io]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this blogpost we showcase a Node.js webapp that does real-time synchronization on multiple machines, which we implemented using Socket.io.]]></description><link>https://blog.risingstack.com/real-time-node-js-webapp-socket-io/</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">602ad403d3345b0001b42cb0</guid><category><![CDATA[Case Studies | @RisingStack]]></category><category><![CDATA[Node.js Best Practices Tutorials | @RisingStack]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Norbert Kovacs]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2021 14:42:56 GMT</pubDate><media:content url=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2021/02/nodejs-real-time-web-socketio.png\" medium=\"image\"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2021/02/nodejs-real-time-web-socketio.png\" alt=\"Building a Real-Time Webapp with Node.js and Socket.io\"><p>In this blogpost we showcase a project we recently finished for <a href=\"https://www.ndi.org/\">National Democratic Institute</a>, an NGO that supports democratic institutions and practices worldwide.

To help parties and campaigns better understand the challenges they face, NDI developed a cybersecurity  simulation (CyberSim) about a political campaign rocked by a range of security incidents. The goal of the CyberSim is to facilitate buy-in for and implementation of better security practices by helping political campaigns assess their own readiness and experience the potential consequences of unmitigated risks.</p>\n<p>The CyberSim is broken down into three core segments: preparation, simulation, and an after action review. During the preparation phase, participants are introduced to a fictional (but realistic) game-play environment, their roles, and the rules of the game. They are also given an opportunity to select security-related mitigations from a limited budget, providing an opportunity to &quot;secure their systems&quot; to the best of their knowledge and ability before the simulation begins.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2021/02/real-time-nodejs-app-with-websocket-socket-io.png\" alt=\"Building a Real-Time Webapp with Node.js and Socket.io\"></p>\n<p>The simulation itself runs for 75 minutes, during which time the participants have the ability to take actions to raise funds, boost support for their candidate and, most importantly, respond to events that occur that may negatively impact their campaign's success. These events are meant to test the readiness, awareness and skills of the participants related to information security best practices. The simulation is designed to mirror the busyness and intensity of a typical campaign environment.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2021/02/socketio-actions.png\" alt=\"Building a Real-Time Webapp with Node.js and Socket.io\"></p>\n<p>The after action review is in many ways the most critical element of the CyberSim exercise. During this segment, CyberSim facilitators and participants review what happened during the simulation, what events lead to which problems during the simulation, and what actions the participants took (or should have taken) to prevent security incidents from occurring. These lessons are closely aligned with the best practices presented in the <a href=\"https://www.ndi.org/publications/cybersecurity-campaign-playbook-global-edition\">Cybersecurity Campaigns Playbook</a>, making the CyberSim an ideal opportunity to reinforce existing knowledge or introduce new best practices presented there.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2021/02/assessment-screen-socketio.png\" alt=\"Building a Real-Time Webapp with Node.js and Socket.io\"></p>\n<p>Since data representation serves as the skeleton of each application, Norbert - who built part of the app will first walk you through the data layer created using <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/knex\">knex</a> and Node.js. Then he will move to the program's hearth, the socket server that manages real-time communication.</p>\n<p>This is going to be a series of articles, so in the next part, we will look at the frontend, which is built with React. Finally, in the third post, Norbert will present the muscle that is the project's infrastructure. We used Amazon's tools to create the CI/CD, host the webserver, the static frontend app, and the database.</p>\n<p>Now that we're through with the intro, you can enjoy reading this Socket.io tutorial / Case Study from Norbert:</p>\n<h2 id=\"theprojectsstructure\">The Project's Structure</h2>\n<p>Before diving deep into the data access layer, let's take a look at the project's structure:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">.\n\n├── migrations\n│   └── ...\n├── seeds\n│   └── ...\n├── src\n│   ├── config.js\n│   ├── logger.js\n│   ├── constants\n│   │   └── ...\n│   ├── models\n│   │   └── ...\n│   ├── util\n│   │   └── ...\n│   ├── app.js\n│   └── socketio.js\n└── index.js\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, the structure is relatively straightforward, as we’re not really deviating from a standard <a href=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-project-structure-tutorial-node-js-at-scale/\">Node.js project structure</a>. To better understand the application, let’s start with the data model.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thedataaccesslayer\">The Data Access Layer</h2>\n<p>Each game starts with a preprogrammed poll percentage and an available budget. Throughout the game, threats (called injections) occur at a predefined time (e.g., in the second minute) to which players have to respond. To spice things up, the staff has several systems required to make responses and take actions. These systems often go down as a result of injections. The game's final goal is simple: the players have to maximize their party's poll by answering each threat.</p>\n<p>We used a PostgreSQL database to store the state of each game. Tables that make up the data model can be classified into two different groups: setup and state tables. Setup tables store data that are identical and constant for each game, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>injections</strong> - contains each threat player face during the game, e.g., <code>Databreach</code></li>\n<li><strong>injection responses</strong> - a one-to-many table that shows the possible reactions for each injection</li>\n<li><strong>action</strong> - operations that have an immediate on-time effect, e.g., <code>Campaign advertisement</code></li>\n<li><strong>systems</strong> - tangible and intangible IT assets, which are prerequisites of specific responses and actions, e.g., <code>HQ Computers</code></li>\n<li><strong>mitigations</strong>  - tangible and intangible assets that mitigate upcoming injections, e.g., <code>Create a secure backup for the online party voter database</code></li>\n<li><strong>roles</strong> - different divisions of a campaign party, e.g., <code>HQ IT Team</code></li>\n<li><strong>curveball events</strong> - one-time events controlled by the facilitators, e.g., <code>Banking system crash</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the other hand, state tables define the state of a game and change during the simulation. These tables are the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>game</strong> - properties of a game like <code>budget</code>, <code>poll</code>, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>game systems</strong> - stores the condition of each system (is it online or offline) throughout the game</li>\n<li><strong>game mitigations</strong> - shows if players have bought each mitigation</li>\n<li><strong>game injection</strong> - stores information about injections that have happened, e.g., <code>was it prevented</code>, <code>responses made to it</code></li>\n<li><strong>game log</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>To help you visualize the database schema, have a look at the following diagram. Please note that the game_log table was intentionally left from the image since it adds unnecessary complexity to the picture and doesn’t really help understand the core functionality of the game:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2021/02/database_schema_socketio.png\" alt=\"Building a Real-Time Webapp with Node.js and Socket.io\"></p>\n<p>To sum up, state tables always store any ongoing game's current state. Each modification done by a facilitator must be saved and then transported back to every coordinator.  To do so, we defined a method in the data access layer to return the current state of the game by calling the following function after the state is updated:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2021/02/socketio_db_schema_faded.png\" alt=\"Building a Real-Time Webapp with Node.js and Socket.io\"></p>\n<br>   \n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// ./src/game.js\nconst db = require('./db');\n\nconst getGame = (id) =&gt;\ndb('game')\n  .select(\n    'game.id',\n    'game.state',\n    'game.poll',\n    'game.budget',\n    'game.started_at',\n    'game.paused',\n    'game.millis_taken_before_started',\n    'i.injections',\n    'm.mitigations',\n    's.systems',\n    'l.logs',\n  )\n  .where({ 'game.id': id })\n  .joinRaw(\n    `LEFT JOIN (SELECT gm.game_id, array_agg(to_json(gm)) AS mitigations FROM game_mitigation gm GROUP BY gm.game_id) m ON m.game_id = game.id`,\n  )\n  .joinRaw(\n    `LEFT JOIN (SELECT gs.game_id, array_agg(to_json(gs)) AS systems FROM game_system gs GROUP BY gs.game_id) s ON s.game_id = game.id`,\n  )\n  .joinRaw(\n    `LEFT JOIN (SELECT gi.game_id, array_agg(to_json(gi)) AS injections FROM game_injection gi GROUP BY gi.game_id) i ON i.game_id = game.id`,\n  )\n  .joinRaw(\n    `LEFT JOIN (SELECT gl.game_id, array_agg(to_json(gl)) AS logs FROM game_log gl GROUP BY gl.game_id) l ON l.game_id = game.id`,\n  )\n  .first();\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>const db = require('./db');</code> line returns a database connection established via knex, used for querying and updating the database. By calling the function above, the current state of a game can be retrieved, including each mitigation already purchased and still available for sale, online and offline systems, injections that have happened, and the game's log. Here is an example of how this logic is applied after a facilitator triggers a curveball event:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// ./src/game.js\nconst performCurveball = async ({ gameId, curveballId }) =&gt; {\n try {\n   const game = await db('game')\n     .select(\n       'budget',\n       'poll',\n       'started_at as startedAt',\n       'paused',\n       'millis_taken_before_started as millisTakenBeforeStarted',\n     )\n     .where({ id: gameId })\n     .first();\n\n   const { budgetChange, pollChange, loseAllBudget } = await db('curveball')\n     .select(\n       'lose_all_budget as loseAllBudget',\n       'budget_change as budgetChange',\n       'poll_change as pollChange',\n     )\n     .where({ id: curveballId })\n     .first();\n\n   await db('game')\n     .where({ id: gameId })\n     .update({\n       budget: loseAllBudget ? 0 : Math.max(0, game.budget + budgetChange),\n       poll: Math.min(Math.max(game.poll + pollChange, 0), 100),\n     });\n\n   await db('game_log').insert({\n     game_id: gameId,\n     game_timer: getTimeTaken(game),\n     type: 'Curveball Event',\n     curveball_id: curveballId,\n   });\n } catch (error) {\n   logger.error('performCurveball ERROR: %s', error);\n   throw new Error('Server error on performing action');\n }\n return getGame(gameId);\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can examine, after the update on the game's state happens, which this time is a change in budget and poll, the program calls the <code>getGame</code> function and returns its result. By applying this logic, we can manage the state easily. We have to arrange each coordinator of the same game into groups, somehow map each possible event to a corresponding function in the <code>models</code> folder, and broadcast the game to everyone after someone makes a change. Let's see how we achieved it by leveraging WebSockets.</p>\n<h2 id=\"creatingourrealtimesocketioserverwithnodejs\">Creating Our Real-Time Socket.io Server with Node.js</h2>\n<p>As the software we’ve created is a companion app to an actual tabletop game played at different locations, it is as real time as it gets. To handle such use cases, where the state of the UI-s needs to be synchronized across multiple clients, WebSockets are the go-to solution. To implement the WebSocket server and client, we chose to use Socket.io. While Socket.io clearly comes with a huge performance overhead, it freed us from a lot of hassle that arises from the stafeful nature of WebSocket connections. As the expected load was minuscule, the overhead Socket.io introduced was way overshadowed by the savings in development time it provided.  One of the killer features of Socket.io that fit our use case very well was that operators who join the same game can be separated easily using socket.io rooms. This way, after a participant updates the game, we can broadcast the new state to the entire room (everyone who currently joined a particular game).</p>\n<p>To create a socket server, all we need is a Server instance created by the createServer method of the default Node.js http module. For maintainability, we organized the socket.io logic into its separate module (see: <code>.src/socketio.js</code>). This module exports a factory function with one argument: an http Server object. Let's have a look at it:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// ./src/socketio.js\nconst socketio = require('socket.io');\n\nconst SocketEvents = require('./constants/SocketEvents');\n\nmodule.exports = (http) =&gt; {\nconst io = socketio(http);\n\nio.on(SocketEvents.CONNECT, (socket) =&gt; {\n  socket.on('EVENT', (input) =&gt; {\n      // DO something with the given input\n  })\n}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// index.js\nconst { createServer } = require('http');\nconst app = require('./src/app'); // Express app\nconst createSocket = require('./src/socketio');\n\nconst port = process.env.PORT || 3001;\nconst http = createServer(app);\ncreateSocket(http);\n\nconst server = http.listen(port, () =&gt; {\n  logger.info(`Server is running at port: ${port}`);\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, the socket server logic is implemented inside the factory function. In the <code>index.js</code> file then this function is called with the http Server. We didn't have to implement authorization during this project, so there isn't any socket.io middleware that authenticates each client before establishing the connection. Inside the socket.io module, we created an event handler for each possible action a facilitator can perform, including the documentation of responses made to injections, buying mitigations, restoring systems, etc. Then we mapped our methods defined in the data access layer to these handlers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bringingtogetherfacilitators\">Bringing together facilitators</h3>\n<p>I previously mentioned that rooms make it easy to distinguish facilitators by which game they currently joined in. A facilitator can enter a room by either creating a fresh new game or joining an existing one. By translating this to &quot;WebSocket language&quot;, a client emits a <code>createGame</code> or <code>joinGame</code> event.  Let's have a look at the corresponding implementation:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// ./src/socketio.js\nconst socketio = require('socket.io');\n\nconst SocketEvents = require('./constants/SocketEvents');\nconst logger = require('./logger');\nconst {\n createGame,\n getGame,\n} = require('./models/game');\n\nmodule.exports = (http) =&gt; {\n const io = socketio(http);\n\n io.on(SocketEvents.CONNECT, (socket) =&gt; {\n   logger.info('Facilitator CONNECT');\n   let gameId = null;\n\n   socket.on(SocketEvents.DISCONNECT, () =&gt; {\n     logger.info('Facilitator DISCONNECT');\n   });\n\n   socket.on(SocketEvents.CREATEGAME, async (id, callback) =&gt; {\n     logger.info('CREATEGAME: %s', id);\n     try {\n       const game = await createGame(id);\n       if (gameId) {\n         await socket.leave(gameId);\n       }\n       await socket.join(id);\n       gameId = id;\n       callback({ game });\n     } catch (_) {\n       callback({ error: 'Game id already exists!' });\n     }\n   });\n\n   socket.on(SocketEvents.JOINGAME, async (id, callback) =&gt; {\n     logger.info('JOINGAME: %s', id);\n     try {\n       const game = await getGame(id);\n       if (!game) {\n         callback({ error: 'Game not found!' });\n       }\n       if (gameId) {\n         await socket.leave(gameId);\n       }\n       await socket.join(id);\n       gameId = id;\n       callback({ game });\n     } catch (error) {\n       logger.error('JOINGAME ERROR: %s', error);\n       callback({ error: 'Server error on join game!' });\n     }\n   });\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you examine the code snippet above, the <code>gameId</code> variable contains the game's id, the facilitators currently joined. By utilizing the javascript closures, we declared this variable inside the <code>connect</code> callback function. Hence the <code>gameId</code> variable will be in all following handlers' scope. If an organizer tries to create a game while already playing (which means that <code>gameId</code> is not null), the socket server first kicks the facilitator out of the previous game's room then joins the facilitator in the new game room. This is managed by the  <code>leave</code> and <code>join</code> methods. The process flow of the <code>joinGame</code> handler is almost identical. The only keys difference is that this time the server doesn't create a new game. Instead, it queries the already existing one using the infamous <code>getGame</code> method of the data access layer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatmakesoureventhandlers\">What Makes Our Event Handlers?</h3>\n<p>After we successfully brought together our facilitators, we had to create a different handler for each possible event. For the sake of completeness, let's look at all the events that occur during a game:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>createGame</code>, <code>joinGame</code>: these events' single purpose is to join the correct game room organizer.</li>\n<li><code>startSimulation</code>, <code>pauseSimulation</code>, <code>finishSimulation</code>: these events are used to start the event's timer, pause the timer, and stop the game entirely. Once someone emits a <code>finishGame</code> event, it can't be restarted.</li>\n<li><code>deliverInjection</code>: using this event, facilitators trigger security threats, which should occur in a given time of the game.</li>\n<li><code>respondToInjection</code>, <code>nonCorrectRespondToInjection</code>: these events record the responses made to injections.</li>\n<li><code>restoreSystem</code>: this event is to restore any system which is offline due to an injection.</li>\n<li><code>changeMitigation</code>: this event is triggered when players buy mitigations to prevent injections.</li>\n<li><code>performAction</code>: when the playing staff performs an action, the client emits this event to the server.</li>\n<li><code>performCurveball</code>: this event occurs when a facilitator triggers unique injections.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These event handlers implement the following rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They take up to two arguments, an optional input, which is different for each event, and a predefined callback. The callback is an exciting feature of socket.io called acknowledgment. It lets us create a callback function on the client-side, which the server can call with either an error or a game object. This call will then affect the client-side. Without diving deep into how the front end works (since this is a topic for another day), this function pops up an alert with either an error or a success message. This message will only appear for the facilitator who initiated the event.</li>\n<li>They update the state of the game by the given inputs according to the event's nature.</li>\n<li>They broadcast the new state of the game to the entire room. Hence we can update the view of all organizers accordingly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>First, let's build on our previous example and see how the handler implemented the curveball events.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// ./src/socketio.js\nconst socketio = require('socket.io');\n\nconst SocketEvents = require('./constants/SocketEvents');\nconst logger = require('./logger');\nconst {\n performCurveball,\n} = require('./models/game');\n\nmodule.exports = (http) =&gt; {\n const io = socketio(http);\n\n io.on(SocketEvents.CONNECT, (socket) =&gt; {\n   logger.info('Facilitator CONNECT');\n   let gameId = null;\n\n   socket.on(\n     SocketEvents.PERFORMCURVEBALL,\n     async ({ curveballId }, callback) =&gt; {\n       logger.info(\n         'PERFORMCURVEBALL: %s',\n         JSON.stringify({ gameId, curveballId }),\n       );\n       try {\n         const game = await performCurveball({\n           gameId,\n           curveballId,\n         });\n         io.in(gameId).emit(SocketEvents.GAMEUPDATED, game);\n         callback({ game });\n       } catch (error) {\n         callback({ error: error.message });\n       }\n     },\n   );\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The curveball event handler takes one input, a <code>curveballId</code> and the callback as mentioned earlier. The <code>performCurveball</code> method then updates the game's poll and budget and returns the new game object. If the update is successful, the socket server emits a <code>gameUpdated</code> event to the game room with the latest state. Then it calls the callback function with the game object. If any error occurs, it is called with an error object.</p>\n<p>After a facilitator creates a game, first, a preparation view is loaded for the players. In this stage, staff members can spend a portion of their budget to buy mitigations before the game starts. Once the game begins, it can be paused, restarted, or even stopped permanently. Let's have a look at the corresponding implementation:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// ./src/socketio.js\nconst socketio = require('socket.io');\n\nconst SocketEvents = require('./constants/SocketEvents');\nconst logger = require('./logger');\nconst {\n startSimulation,\n pauseSimulation\n} = require('./models/game');\n\nmodule.exports = (http) =&gt; {\n const io = socketio(http);\n\n io.on(SocketEvents.CONNECT, (socket) =&gt; {\n   logger.info('Facilitator CONNECT');\n   let gameId = null;\n\n   socket.on(SocketEvents.STARTSIMULATION, async (callback) =&gt; {\n     logger.info('STARTSIMULATION: %s', gameId);\n     try {\n       const game = await startSimulation(gameId);\n       io.in(gameId).emit(SocketEvents.GAMEUPDATED, game);\n       callback({ game });\n     } catch (error) {\n       callback({ error: error.message });\n     }\n   });\n\n   socket.on(SocketEvents.PAUSESIMULATION, async (callback) =&gt; {\n     logger.info('PAUSESIMULATION: %s', gameId);\n     try {\n       const game = await pauseSimulation({ gameId });\n       io.in(gameId).emit(SocketEvents.GAMEUPDATED, game);\n       callback({ game });\n     } catch (error) {\n       callback({ error: error.message });\n     }\n   });\n\n   socket.on(SocketEvents.FINISHSIMULATION, async (callback) =&gt; {\n     logger.info('FINISHSIMULATION: %s', gameId);\n     try {\n       const game = await pauseSimulation({ gameId, finishSimulation: true });\n       io.in(gameId).emit(SocketEvents.GAMEUPDATED, game);\n       callback({ game });\n     } catch (error) {\n       callback({ error: error.message });\n     }\n   });\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>startSimulation</code> kicks the game's timer, and the <code>pauseSimulation</code> method pauses and stops the game. Trigger time is essential to determine which injection facilitators can invoke. After organizers trigger a threat, they hand over all necessary assets to the players. Staff members can then choose how they respond to the injection by providing a custom response or choosing from the predefined options. Next to facing threats, staff members perform actions, restore systems, and buy mitigations. The corresponding events to these activities can be triggered anytime during the game. These event handlers follow the same pattern and implement ourthe three fundamental rules. Please check the <a href=\"https://github.com/nditech/CyberSim-Backend\">public GitHub repo</a> if you would like to examine these callbacks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"servingthesetupdata\">Serving The Setup Data</h2>\n<p>In the chapter explaining the data access layer, I classified tables into two different groups: setup and state tables. State tables contain the condition of ongoing games. This data is served and updated via the event-based socket server. On the other hand, setup data consists of the available systems, game mitigations, actions, and curveball events, injections that occur during the game, and each possible response to them. This data is exposed via a simple http server.  After a facilitator joins a game, the React client requests this data and caches and uses it throughout the game. The HTTP server is implemented using the express library. Let's have a look at our app.js.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// .src/app.js\nconst helmet = require('helmet');\nconst express = require('express');\nconst cors = require('cors');\nconst expressPino = require('express-pino-logger');\n\nconst logger = require('./logger');\nconst { getResponses } = require('./models/response');\nconst { getInjections } = require('./models/injection');\nconst { getActions } = require('./models/action');\n\nconst app = express();\n\napp.use(helmet());\napp.use(cors());\napp.use(\n expressPino({\n   logger,\n }),\n);\n\n// STATIC DB data is exposed via REST api\n\napp.get('/mitigations', async (req, res) =&gt; {\n const records = await db('mitigation');\n res.json(records);\n});\n\napp.get('/systems', async (req, res) =&gt; {\n const records = await db('system');\n res.json(records);\n});\n\napp.get('/injections', async (req, res) =&gt; {\n const records = await getInjections();\n res.json(records);\n});\n\napp.get('/responses', async (req, res) =&gt; {\n const records = await getResponses();\n res.json(records);\n});\n\napp.get('/actions', async (req, res) =&gt; {\n const records = await getActions();\n res.json(records);\n});\n\napp.get('/curveballs', async (req, res) =&gt; {\n const records = await db('curveball');\n res.json(records);\n});\n\nmodule.exports = app;\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, everything is pretty standard here. We didn't need to implement any method other than <code>GET</code> since this data is inserted and changed using seeds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"finalthoughtsonoursocketiogame\">Final Thoughts On Our Socket.io Game</h2>\n<p>Now we can put together how the backend works. State tables store the games' state, and the data access layer returns the new game state after each update. The socket server organizes the facilitators into rooms, so each time someone changes something, the new game is broadcasted to the entire room. Hence we can make sure that everyone has an up-to-date view of the game. In addition to dynamic game data, static tables are accessible via the http server.</p>\n<p>Next time, we will look at how the React client manages all this, and after that I'll present the infrastructure behind the project.

Peer dependencies are now installed by default.</p>\n<p><strong>Throw on unhandled rejections:</strong> As of Node.js 15, the default mode for <code>unhandledRejection</code> is changed to <code>throw</code> (from <code>warn</code>). In <code>throw</code> mode, if an <code>unhandledRejection</code> hook is not set, the <code>unhandledRejection</code> is raised as an uncaught exception. Users that have an <code>unhandledRejection</code> hook should see no change in behavior, and it’s still possible to switch modes using the <code>--unhandled-rejections=mode</code> process flag.</p>\n<p><strong>QUIC (experimental):</strong> QUIC is a UDP-based, underlying transport protocol for HTTP/3. QUIC features inbuilt security with TLS 1.3, flow control, error correction, connection migration, and multiplexing. QUIC can be enabled by compiling Node.js with the <code>--experimental-quic</code> configuration flag. The Node.js QUIC implementation is exposed by the core <code>net</code> module.</p>\n<p><strong>V8 8.6:</strong> The V8 JavaScript engine has been updated to V8 8.6 (V8 8.4 is the latest available in Node.js 14). Along with performance tweaks and improvements the V8 update also brings the following language features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Promise.any()</code> (from V8 8.5)</li>\n<li><code>AggregateError</code> (from V8 8.5)</li>\n<li><code>String.prototype.replaceAll()</code> (from V8 8.5)</li>\n<li>Logical assignment operators <code>&amp;&amp;=</code>, <code>||=</code>, and <code>??=</code> (from V8 8.5)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Source, and even more info: <a href=\"https://nodejs.medium.com/node-js-v15-0-0-is-here-deb00750f278\">Node.js v15.0.0 is here! by Bethany Griggs<br>\n</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"nodejsltsv15changelogs\">Node.js LTS v15 Changelogs</h2>\n<h4 id=\"changelogfornodev1560current\">Changelog for Node v15.6.0 (Current)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>child_process:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>add 'overlapped' stdio flag</li>\n<li>support AbortSignal in fork</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>crypto:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>implement basic secure heap support</li>\n<li>fixup bug in keygen error handling</li>\n<li>introduce X509Certificate API</li>\n<li>implement randomuuid</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>doc:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>update release key for Danielle Adams</li>\n<li>add dnlup to collaborators</li>\n<li>add panva to collaborators</li>\n<li>add yashLadha to collaborator</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>http:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>set lifo as the default scheduling strategy in Agent</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>net:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>support abortSignal in server.listen</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>process:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>add direct access to rss without iterating pages</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>v8:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>fix native serdes constructors</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"changelogfornodev1551current\">Changelog for Node v15.5.1 (Current)</h4>\n<p>This is a security release. Vulnerabilities fixed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>CVE-2020-8265: use-after-free in TLSWrap (High):</strong> Affected Node.js versions are vulnerable to a use-after-free bug in its TLS implementation. When writing to a TLS enabled socket, node::StreamBase::Write calls node::TLSWrap::DoWrite with a freshly allocated WriteWrap object as first argument. If the DoWrite method does not return an error, this object is passed back to the caller as part of a StreamWriteResult structure. This may be exploited to corrupt memory leading to a Denial of Service or potentially other exploits.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>CVE-2020-8287: HTTP Request Smuggling in nodejs (Low):</strong> Affected versions of Node.js allow two copies of a header field in a http request. For example, two Transfer-Encoding header fields. In this case Node.js identifies the first header field and ignores the second. This can lead to HTTP Request Smuggling.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"changelogfornodev1550current\">Changelog for Node v15.5.0 (Current)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>OpenSSL-1.1.1i:</strong> OpenSSL-1.1.1i contains a fix for CVE-2020-1971: OpenSSL - EDIPARTYNAME NULL pointer de-reference (High). This is a vulnerability in OpenSSL which may be exploited through Node.js.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Extended support for AbortSignal in child_process and stream:</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following APIs now support an <code>AbortSignal</code> in their options object:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>child_process.spawn(): Calling <code>.abort()</code> on the corresponding <code>AbortController</code> is similar to calling <code>.kill()</code> on the child process except the error passed to the callback will be an <code>AbortError</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>new stream.Writable()</code> and <code>new stream.Readable()</code>: Calling <code>.abort()</code> on the corresponding <code>AbortController</code> will behave the same way as calling <code>.destroy(new AbortError())</code> on the stream</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>BigInt support in <code>querystring.stringify()</code>:</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If <code>querystring.stringify()</code> is called with an object that contains <code>BigInt</code> values, they will now be serialized to their decimal representation instead of the empty string.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Additions to the C++ embedder APIs:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A new <code>IsolateSettingsFlag</code> is available for those calling <code>SetIsolateUpForNode()</code> : <code>SHOULD_NOT_SET_PREPARE_STACK_TRACE_CALLBACK</code> can be used to prevent Node.js from setting a custom callback to prepare stack traces.</p>\n<h4 id=\"changelogfornodev1540current\">Changelog for Node v15.4.0 (Current)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>child_processes:</strong> add AbortSignal support</li>\n<li><strong>deps:</strong> update ICU to 68.1</li>\n<li><strong>events:</strong> support signal in EventTarget</li>\n<li><strong>events:</strong> graduate Event, EventTarget, AbortController</li>\n<li><strong>http:</strong> enable call chaining with setHeader()</li>\n<li><strong>module:</strong> add isPreloading indicator</li>\n<li><strong>stream:</strong> support abort signal</li>\n<li><strong>stream:</strong> add FileHandle support to Read/WriteStream</li>\n<li><strong>worker:</strong> add experimental BroadcastChannel</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"changelogfornodev1530current\">Changelog for Node v15.3.0 (Current)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>dns:</strong> add a cancel() method to the promise Resolver</li>\n<li><strong>events:</strong> add max listener warning for EventTarget</li>\n<li><strong>http:</strong> add support for abortsignal to http.request</li>\n<li><strong>http2:</strong> allow setting the local window size of a session</li>\n<li><strong>lib:</strong> add throws option to fs.f/l/statSync</li>\n<li><strong>path:</strong> add <code>path/posix</code> and <code>path/win32</code> alias modules</li>\n<li><strong>readline:</strong> add getPrompt to get the current prompt</li>\n<li><strong>src:</strong> add loop idle time in diagnostic report</li>\n<li><strong>util:</strong> add <code>util/types</code> alias module</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"changelogfornodev1520current\">Changelog for Node v15.2.0 (Current)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>events:</strong> getEventListeners static</li>\n<li><strong>fs:</strong> support abortsignal in writeFile, add support for AbortSignal in readFile</li>\n<li><strong>stream:</strong> fix thrown object reference</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"changelogfornodev1510current\">Changelog for Node v15.1.0 (Current)</h4>\n<p><strong>Diagnostics channel (experimental module):</strong> <code>diagnostics_channel</code> is a new experimental module that provides an API to create named channels to report arbitrary message data for diagnostics purposes. With <code>diagnostics_channel</code>, Node.js core and module authors can publish contextual data about what they are doing at a given time. This could be the hostname and query string of a mysql query, for example.</p>\n<p><strong>New child process <code>'spawn'</code> event:</strong> Instances of <code>ChildProcess</code> now emit a new <code>'spawn'</code> event once the child process has spawned successfully. If emitted, the <code>'spawn'</code> event comes before all other events and before any data is received via stdout or stderr. The <code>'spawn'</code> event will fire regardless of whether an error occurs within the spawned process. For example, if <code>bash some-command</code> spawns successfully, the <code>'spawn'</code> event will fire, though <code>bash</code> may fail to spawn <code>some-command</code>. This caveat also applies when using <code>{ shell: true }.</code></p>\n<p><strong>Set the local address for DNS resolution:</strong> It is now possible to set the local IP address used by a <code>Resolver</code> instance to send its requests. This allows programs to specify outbound interfaces when used on multi-homed systems. The resolver will use the v4 local address when making requests to IPv4 DNS servers, and the v6 local address when making requests to IPv6 DNS servers.</p>\n<p><strong>Control V8 coverage at runtime:</strong> The v8 module includes two new methods to control the V8 coverage started by the <code>NODE_V8_COVERAGE</code> environment variable. With <code>v8.takeCoverage()</code>, it is possible to write a coverage report to disk on demand. This can be done multiple times during the lifetime of the process, and the execution counter will be reset on each call. When the process is about to exit, one last coverage will still be written to disk, unless <code>v8.stopCoverage()</code> was invoked before. The <code>v8.stopCoverage()</code> method allows to stop the coverage collection, so that V8 can release the execution counters and optimize code.</p>\n<p><strong>Analyze Worker's event loop utilization:</strong> <code>Worker</code> instances now have a <code>performance</code> property, with a single <code>eventLoopUtilization</code> method that can be used to gather information about the worker's event loop utilization between the <code>'online'</code> and <code>'exit'</code> events. The method works the same way as <code>perf_hooks</code> <code>eventLoopUtilization().</code></p>\n<p><strong>Take a V8 heap snapshot just before running out of memory (experimental):</strong><br>\nWith the new <code>--heapsnapshot-near-heap-limit=max_count</code> experimental command line flag, it is now possible to automatically generate a heap snapshot when the V8 heap usage is approaching the heap limit. <code>count</code> should be a non-negative integer (in which case Node.js will write no more than <code>max_count</code> snapshots to disk). When generating snapshots, garbage collection may be triggered and bring the heap usage down, therefore multiple snapshots may be written to disk before the Node.js instance finally runs out of memory. These heap snapshots can be compared to determine what objects are being allocated during the time consecutive snapshots are taken.</p>\n<h4 id=\"changelogfornodev1501current\">Changelog for Node v15.0.1 (Current)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>crypto:</strong> fix regression on randomFillSync</li>\n<li><strong>deps:</strong> upgrade npm to 7.0.3</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"nodejsv14highlights\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/@nodejs/node-js-version-14-available-now-8170d384567e\">Node.js v14 Highlights</a></h2>\n<p>The highlights in this release include improved diagnostics, an upgrade of V8, an experimental Async Local Storage API, hardening of the streams APIs, removal of the Experimental Modules warning, and the removal of some long deprecated APIs.</p>\n<p>Node.js 14 was promoted to Long-term Support (LTS) in October 2020. As a reminder — both Node.js 12 and Node.js 10 will remain in long-term support until April 2022 and April 2021 respectively.</p>\n<h2 id=\"nodejsltsv14changelogs\">Node.js LTS v14 Changelogs</h2>\n<h4 id=\"changelogfornodev14154current\">Changelog for Node v14.15.4 (Current)</h4>\n<p>This is a security release.

But how should you decide?\"><p>At <a href=\"https://risingstack.com/\">RisingStack</a>, we help companies to adopt <a href=\"https://risingstack.com/devops-sre-cloud-consulting-services\">cloud-native technologies</a>, or if they have already done so, to get the most mileage out of them.</p>\n<p><strong>Recently, I've been invited to Google DevFest to deliver a presentation on our experiences working with Kubernetes.</strong></p>\n<p>Below I talk about an online learning and streaming platform where the decision to use Kubernetes has been contested both internally and externally since the beginning of its development.</p>\n<p>The application and its underlying infrastructure were designed to meet the needs of the regulations of several countries:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The app should be able to run on-premises, so students’ data could never leave a given country. Also, the app had to be available as a SaaS product as well.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It can be deployed as a single-tenant system where a business customer only hosts one instance serving a handful of users, but some schools could have hundreds of users.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Or it can be deployed as a multi-tenant system where the client is e.g. a government and needs to serve thousands of schools and millions of users.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The application itself was developed by multiple, geographically scattered teams, thus a Microservices architecture was justified, but both the distributed system and the underlying infrastructure seemed to be an overkill when we considered the fact that during the product's initial entry, most of its customers needed small instances.</p>\n<p><strong>Was Kubernetes suited for the job, or was it an overkill? Did our client really need Kubernetes?</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s figure it out.</p>\n<p><em>(Feel free to check out the video presentation, or the extended article version below!)</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JXSPoV73zjA\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<h2 id=\"letstalkabitaboutkubernetesitself\">Let's talk a bit about Kubernetes itself!</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration engine that has a vast ecosystem. If you run into any kind of problem, there's probably a library somewhere on the internet that already solves it.</p>\n<p>But Kubernetes also has a daunting learning curve, and initially, it's pretty complex to manage. Cloud ops / infrastructure engineering is a complex and big topic in and of itself.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes does not really mask away the complexity from you, but plunges you into deep water as it merely gives you a unified control plane to handle all those moving parts that you need to care about in the cloud.</p>\n<p>So, if you're just starting out right now, then it's better to start with small things and not with the whole package straight away! First, deploy a VM in the cloud. Use some PaaS or FaaS solutions to play around with one of your apps. It will help you gradually build up the knowledge you need on the journey.</p>\n<h2 id=\"soyouwanttodecideifkubernetesisforyou\">So you want to decide if Kubernetes is for you.</h2>\n<p>First and foremost, Kubernetes is for you if you work with containers! (It kinda speaks for itself for a container orchestration system). But you should also have more than one service or instance.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/11/kubernetes-is-for-you-if.png\" alt=\"Sometimes you do need Kubernetes! But how should you decide?\"></p>\n<p>Kubernetes makes sense when you have a huge microservice architecture, or you have dedicated instances per tenant having a lot of tenants as well.</p>\n<p>Also, your services should be stateless, and your state should be stored in databases outside of the cluster. Another selling point of Kubernetes is the fine gradient control over the network.</p>\n<p>And, maybe the most common argument for using Kubernetes is that it provides easy scalability.</p>\n<p>Okay, and now let's take a look at the flip side of it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"kubernetesisnotforyouifyoudontneedscalability\">Kubernetes is not for you if you don't need scalability!</h2>\n<p>If your services rely heavily on disks, then you should think twice if you want to move to Kubernetes or not. Basically, one disk can only be attached to a single node, so all the services need to reside on that one node. Therefore you lose node auto-scaling, which is one of the biggest selling points of Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>For similar reasons, you probably shouldn't use k8s if you don't host your infrastructure in the public cloud. When you run your app on-premises, you need to buy the hardware beforehand and you cannot just conjure machines out of thin air. So basically, you also lose node auto-scaling, unless you're willing to go hybrid cloud and bleed over some of your excess load by spinning up some machines in the public cloud.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/11/kubernetes-is-not-for-you-if.png\" alt=\"Sometimes you do need Kubernetes! But how should you decide?\"></p>\n<p>If you have a monolithic application that serves all your customers and you need some scaling here and there, then cloud service providers can handle it for you with autoscaling groups.</p>\n<p>There is really no need to bring in Kubernetes for that.</p>\n<h2 id=\"letsseeourkubernetescasestudy\">Let's see our Kubernetes case-study!</h2>\n<p>Maybe it's a little bit more tangible if we talk about an actual use case, where we had to go through the decision making process.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/11/online-learning-platform-kubernetes.png\" alt=\"Sometimes you do need Kubernetes! But how should you decide?\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://onlinelearningplatform.com/\">Online Learning Platform</a> is an application that you could imagine as if you took your classroom and moved it to the internet.</p>\n<p>You can have conference calls. You can share files as handouts, you can have a whiteboard, and you can track the progress of your students.</p>\n<p>This project started during the first wave of the lockdowns around March, so one thing that we needed to keep in mind is that time to market was essential.</p>\n<p><strong>In other words: we had to do everything very, very quickly!</strong></p>\n<p>This product targets mostly schools around Europe, but it is now used by corporations as well.</p>\n<h2 id=\"soweretalkingaboutmillionsofusersfromthepointwegotothemarket\">So, we're talking about millions of users from the point we go to the market.</h2>\n<p>The product needed to run on-premise, because one of the main targets were governments.</p>\n<p>Initially, we were provided with a proposed infrastructure where each school would have its own VM, and all the services and all the databases would reside in those VMs.</p>\n<p>Handling that many virtual machines, properly handling rollouts to those, and monitoring all of them sounded like a nightmare to begin with. Especially if we consider the fact that we only had a couple of weeks to go live.</p>\n<p>After studying the requirements and the proposal, it was time to call the client to..</p>\n<h2 id=\"discusstheproposedinfrastructure\">Discuss the proposed infrastructure.</h2>\n<p>So the conversation was something like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>&quot;Hi guys, we would prefer to go with Kubernetes because to handle stuff at that scale, we would need a unified control plane that Kubernetes gives us.&quot;</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>&quot;Yeah, sure, go for it.&quot;</code></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And we were happy, but we still had a couple of questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>&quot;Could we, by any chance, host it on the public cloud?&quot;</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>&quot;Well, no, unfortunately. We are negotiating with European local governments and they tend to be squeamish about sending their data to the US. &quot;</code></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Okay, anyways, we can figure something out...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>&quot;But do the services need filesystem access?&quot;</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>&quot;Yes, they do.&quot;</code></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Okay, crap! But we still needed to talk to the developers so all was not lost.</p>\n<h2 id=\"letscallthedevelopers\">Let's call the developers!</h2>\n<p>It turned out that what we were dealing with was an usual microservice-based architecture, which consisted of a lot of services talking over HTTP and messaging queues.</p>\n<p>Each service had its own database, and most of them stored some files in Minio.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/11/kubernetes-app-architecture.png\" alt=\"Sometimes you do need Kubernetes! But how should you decide?\"></p>\n<p>In case you don't know it, Minio is an object storage system that implements the S3 API.</p>\n<p>Now that we knew the fine-grained architectural layout, we gathered a few more questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>&quot;Okay guys, can we move all the files to Minio?&quot;</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>&quot;Yeah, sure, easy peasy.&quot;</code></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, we were happy again, but there was still another problem, so we had to call the hosting providers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>&quot;Hi guys, do you provide hosted Kubernetes?&quot;</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>&quot;Oh well, at this scale, we can manage to do that!&quot;</code></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, we were happy again, but..</p>\n<h2 id=\"justtomakesurewewantedtorunthenumbers\">Just to make sure, we wanted to run the numbers!</h2>\n<p>Our target was to be able to run 60 000 schools on the platform in the beginning, so we had to see if our plans lined up with <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/best-practices/cluster-large/\">our limitations</a>!</p>\n<p><strong>We shouldn't have more than 150 000 total pods!</strong></p>\n<p>10 (pod/tenant) times 6000 tenants is 60 000 Pods. We're good!</p>\n<p><strong>We shouldn't have more than 300 000 total containers!</strong></p>\n<p>It's one container per pod, so we're still good.</p>\n<p><strong>We shouldn't have more than 100 pods per node and no more than 5 000 nodes.</strong></p>\n<p>Well, what we have is 60 000 pods over 100 pod per node. That's already 6 000 nodes, and that's just the initial rollout, so we're already over our 5 000 nodes limit.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/11/kubernetes-limitations.png\" alt=\"Sometimes you do need Kubernetes! But how should you decide?\"></p>\n<p>Okay, well... Crap!</p>\n<p>But,  is there a solution to this?</p>\n<p>Sure, it's federation!</p>\n<h2 id=\"wecouldfederateourkubernetesclusters\">We could federate our Kubernetes clusters..</h2>\n<p>..and overcome these limitations.</p>\n<p>We have worked with federated systems before, so Kubernetes surely provides something for that, riiight? Well yeah, it does... kind of.</p>\n<p>It's the stable Federation v1 API, which is sadly deprecated.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/11/kubernetes-federation-v1.png\" alt=\"Sometimes you do need Kubernetes! But how should you decide?\"></p>\n<p>Then we saw that Kubernetes Federation v2 is on the way!</p>\n<p>It was still in alpha at the time when we were dealing with this issue, but the GitHub page said it was rapidly moving towards beta release. By taking a look at the releases page we realized that it had been overdue by half a year by then.</p>\n<p>Since we only had a short period of time to pull this off, we really didn't want to live that much on the edge.</p>\n<p>So what could we do? We could federate by hand! But what does that mean?</p>\n<p><strong>In other words: what could have been gained by using KubeFed?</strong></p>\n<p>Having a lot of services would have meant that we needed a federated Prometheus and Logging (be it Graylog or ELK) anyway. So the two remaining aspects of the system were rollout / tenant generation, and manual intervention.</p>\n<p>Manual intervention is tricky. To make it easy, you need a unified control plane where you can eyeball and modify anything. We could have built a custom one that gathers all information from the clusters and proxies all requests to each of them. However, that would have meant a lot of work, which we just did not have the time for. And even if we had the time to do it, we would have needed to conduct a cost/benefit analysis on it.</p>\n<p><strong>The main factor in the decision if you need a unified control plane for <em>everything</em> is scale, or in other words, the number of different control planes to handle.</strong></p>\n<p>The original approach would have meant 6000 different planes. That’s just way too much to handle for a small team. But if we could bring it down to 20 or so, that could be bearable. In that case, all we need is an easy mind map that leads from services to their underlying clusters. The actual route would be something like:</p>\n<p>Service -&gt; Tenant (K8s Namespace) -&gt; Cluster.</p>\n<p>The Service -&gt; Namespace mapping is provided by Kubernetes, so we needed to figure out the Namespace -&gt; Cluster mapping.</p>\n<p>This mapping is also necessary to reduce the cognitive overhead and time of digging around when an outage may happen, so it needs to be easy to remember, while having to provide a more or less uniform distribution of tenants across Clusters. The most straightforward way seemed to be to base it on Geography. I’m the most familiar with Poland’s and Hungary’s Geography, so let’s take them as an example.</p>\n<p>Poland comprises 16 voivodeships, while Hungary comprises 19 counties as main administrative divisions. Each country’s capital stands out in population, so they have enough schools to get a cluster on their own. Thus it only makes sense to create clusters for each division plus the capital. That gives us 17 or 20 clusters.</p>\n<p>So if we get back to our original 60 000 pods, and 100 pod / tenant limitation, we can see that 2 clusters are enough to host them all, but that leaves us no room for either scaling or later expansions. If we spread them across 17 clusters - in the case of Poland for example - that means we have around 3.500 pods / cluster and 350 nodes, which is still manageable.</p>\n<p>This could be done in a similar fashion for any European country, but still needs some architecting when setting up the actual infrastructure. And when KubeFed becomes available (and somewhat battle tested) we can easily join these clusters into one single federated cluster.</p>\n<p>Great, we have solved the problem of control planes for manual intervention. The only thing left was handling rollouts..</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/11/gitops-kubernetes-federation.png\" alt=\"Sometimes you do need Kubernetes! But how should you decide?\"></p>\n<p>As I mentioned before, several developer teams had been working on the services themselves, and each of them already had their own Gitlab repos and CIs. They already built their own Docker images, so we simply needed a place to gather them all, and roll them out to Kubernetes. So we created a GitOps repo where we stored the helm charts and set up a GitLab CI to build the actual releases, then deploy them.</p>\n<p>From here on, it takes a simple loop over the clusters to update the services when necessary.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theotherthingweneededtosolvewastenantgeneration\">The other thing we needed to solve was tenant generation.</h2>\n<p>It was easy as well, because we just needed to create a CLI tool which could be set up by providing the school's name, and its county or state.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/11/tenant-generation-kubernetes.png\" alt=\"Sometimes you do need Kubernetes! But how should you decide?\"></p>\n<p>That's going to designate its target cluster, and then push it to our Gitops repo, and that basically triggers the same rollout as new versions.</p>\n<p><strong>We were almost good to go, but there was still one problem: on-premises.</strong></p>\n<p>Although our hosting providers turned into some kind of public cloud (or something we can think of as public clouds), we were also targeting companies who want to educate their employees.</p>\n<p>Huge corporations - like a Bank - are just as squeamish about sending their data out to the public internet as governments, if not more..</p>\n<p>So we needed to figure out a way to host this on servers within vaults completely separated from the public internet.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/11/kubespray.png\" alt=\"Sometimes you do need Kubernetes! But how should you decide?\"></p>\n<p>In this case, we had two main modes of operation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>One is when a company just wanted a boxed product and they didn't really care about scaling it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>And the other one was where they expected it to be scaled, but they were prepared to handle this.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the second case, it was kind of a bring your own database scenario, so you could set up the system in a way that we were going to connect to your database.</p>\n<p>And in the other case, what we could do is to package everything — including databases — in one VM, in one Kubernetes cluster. But! I just wrote above that you probably shouldn't use disks and shouldn't have databases within your cluster, right?</p>\n<p>However, in that case, we already had a working infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes provided us with infrastructure as code already, so it only made sense to use that as a packaging tool as well, and use Kubespray to just spray it to our target servers.</p>\n<p>It wasn't a problem to have disks and DBs within our cluster because the target were companies that didn't want to scale it anyway.</p>\n<h2 id=\"soitsnotaboutscalingitismostlyaboutpackaging\">So it's not about scaling.

While a series can’t help you getting to this level, we could write some code that we can physically feel when it’s working, so we’ll be aiming for that.</p>\n<p><strong>The concept of this game is that there is a shape hidden on the screen. Tapping the hidden shape will trigger a gentle haptic feedback on iPhones and a basic vibration on Android devices. Based on where you feel the shape, you’ll be able to guess which one of the three possible shapes is hidden on the screen.</strong></p>\n<p>Before getting to code, I created a basic design for the project. I kept the feature set, the distractions on the UI, and the overall feeling of the app as simple and chic as possible. This means no colorful stuff, no flashy stuff, some gentle animations, no in-app purchases, no ads, and no tracking.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/11/shapeblinder-dart-flutter-game-design.png\" alt=\"Case Study: Building a Mobile Game with Dart and Flutter\"></p>\n<p>We’ll have a home screen, a game screen and a “you lost” screen. A title-subtitle group will be animated across these screens. Tapping anywhere on the home screen will start, and on the lost screen will restart the game. We’ll also have some data persistency for storing the high scores of the user.</p>\n<p>The full source code is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/RisingStack/shapeblinder\">GitHub here</a>. You can download the built application from both <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hu.danielgrgly.shapeblinder\">Google Play</a> and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/hu/app/shapeblinder/id1523640121\">App Store</a>.</p>\n<p>Now go play around with the game, and after that, we’ll get started! ✨</p>\n<h2 id=\"initializingtheproject\">Initializing the project</h2>\n<p>First, and foremost, I used the already discussed <code>flutter create shapeblinder</code> CLI command. Then, I deleted most of the code and created my usual go-to project structure for Flutter:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">├── README.md\n├── android\n├── assets\n├── build\n├── ios\n├── lib\n│   ├── core\n│   │   └── ...\n│   ├── main.dart\n│   └── ui\n│       ├── screens\n│       │   └── ...\n│       └── widgets\n│           └── ...\n├── pubspec.lock\n└── pubspec.yaml\n</code></pre>\n<p>Inside the <code>lib</code>, I usually create a <code>core</code> and a <code>ui</code> directory to separate the business logic from the UI code. Inside the <code>ui</code> dir, I also add a <code>screens</code> and <code>widgets</code> directory. I like keeping these well-separated - however, these are just my own preferences!</p>\n<p>Feel free to experiment with other project structures on your own and see which one is the one you naturally click with. (The most popular project structures you may want to consider are MVC, MVVM, or BLoC, but the possibilities are basically endless!)</p>\n<p>After setting up the folder structure, I usually set up the routing with some very basic empty screens. To achieve this, I created a few dummy screens inside the <code>lib/ui/screens/...</code>. A simple centered text widget with the name of the screen will do it for now:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">// lib/ui/screens/Home.dart\n \nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\n \nclass Home extends StatelessWidget {\n @override\n Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n   return Scaffold(\n     body: Center(\n       child: Text(&quot;home&quot;),\n     ),\n   );\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that I only used classes, methods, and widgets that we previously discussed. Just a basic <code>StatelessWidget</code> with a <code>Scaffold</code> so that our app has a body, and a <code>Text</code> wrapped with a <code>Center</code>. Nothing heavy there. I copied and pasted this code into the <code>Game.dart</code> and <code>Lost.dart</code> files too, so that I can set up the routing in the <code>main.dart</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">// lib/main.dart\n \nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\n \n// import the screens we created in the previous step\nimport './ui/screens/Home.dart';\nimport './ui/screens/Game.dart';\nimport './ui/screens/Lost.dart';\n \n// the entry point to our app\nvoid main() {\n runApp(Shapeblinder());\n}\n \nclass Shapeblinder extends StatelessWidget {\n @override\n Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n   return MaterialApp(\n     title: 'ShapeBlinder',\n     // define the theme data\n     // i only added the fontFamily to the default theme\n     theme: ThemeData(\n       primarySwatch: Colors.grey,\n       visualDensity: VisualDensity.adaptivePlatformDensity,\n       fontFamily: &quot;Muli&quot;,\n     ),\n     home: Home(),\n     // add in the routes\n     // we'll be able to use them later in the Navigator.pushNamed method\n     routes: &lt;String, WidgetBuilder&gt;{\n       '/home': (BuildContext context) =&gt; Home(),\n       '/game': (BuildContext context) =&gt; Game(),\n       '/lost': (BuildContext context) =&gt; Lost(),\n     },\n   );\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Make sure that you read the code comments for some short inline explanation!</strong> Since we already discussed these topics, I don’t really want to take that much time into explaining these concepts from the ground up - we’re just putting them into practice to see how they work before you get your hands dirty with real-life projects.</p>\n<h2 id=\"addingassetssettingupthefont\">Adding assets, setting up the font</h2>\n<p>You may have noticed that I threw in a <code>fontFamily: “Muli”</code> in the theme data. How do we add this font to our project? There are several ways: you could, for example, use the <a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts\">Google Fonts package</a>, or manually add the font file to the project. While using the package may be handy for some, I prefer bundling the fonts together with the app, so we’ll add them manually.</p>\n<p>The first step is to acquire the font files: in Flutter, <code>.ttf</code> is the preferred format. You can grab the Muli font this project uses from <a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Muli\">Google Fonts here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>(<em>Update</em>: the font has been removed from Google Fonts. You’ll be able to download it soon bundled together with other assets such as the app icon and the <code>svg</code>s, or you could also use a new, almost identical font by the very same author, <a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mulish\">Mulish</a>)</em>.</p>\n<p>Then, move the files somewhere inside your project. The <code>assets/fonts</code> directory is a perfect place for your font files - create it, move the files there and register the fonts in the <code>pubspec.yaml</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">flutter:\n fonts:\n   - family: Muli\n     fonts:\n       - asset: assets/fonts/Muli.ttf\n       - asset: assets/fonts/Muli-Italic.ttf\n         style: italic\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can see that we were able to add the normal and italic versions in a single family: because of this, we won’t need to use altered font names (like “Muli-Italic”). After this - boom! You’re done. 💥 Since we previously specified the font in the app-level theme, we won’t need to refer to it anywhere else - every rendered text will use Muli from now on.</p>\n<p>Now, let’s add some additional assets and the app icon. We’ll have some basic shapes as SVGs that we’ll display on the bottom bar of the Game screen. You can grab every asset (including the app icon, font files, and svgs) <a href=\"https://risingstack-blog.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/2020/flutter/assets.zip\">from here</a>. You can just unzip this and move it into the root of your project and expect everything to be fine.</p>\n<p>Before being able to use your svgs in the app, you need to register them in the <code>pubspec.yaml</code>, just like you had to register the fonts:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">flutter:\n uses-material-design: true\n \n assets:\n   - assets/svg/tap.svg\n \n   - assets/svg/circle.svg\n   - assets/svg/cross.svg\n   - assets/svg/donut.svg\n   - assets/svg/line.svg\n   - assets/svg/oval.svg\n   - assets/svg/square.svg\n \n fonts:\n   - family: Muli\n     fonts:\n       - asset: assets/fonts/Muli.ttf\n       - asset: assets/fonts/Muli-Italic.ttf\n         style: italic\n</code></pre>\n<p>And finally, to set up the launcher icon (the icon that shows up in the system UI), we’ll use a handy third-party package <a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_launcher_icons\"><code>flutter_launcher_icons</code></a>. Just add this package into the <code>dev_dependencies</code> below the normal deps in the <code>pubspec.yaml</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">dev_dependencies:\n flutter_launcher_icons: &quot;^0.7.3&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>...and then configure it, either in the <code>pubspec.yaml</code> or by creating a <code>flutter_launcher_icons.yaml</code> config file. A very basic configuration is going to be just enough for now:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">flutter_icons:\n android: &quot;launcher_icon&quot;\n ios: true\n image_path: &quot;assets/logo.png&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then, you can just run the following commands, and the script will set up the launcher icons for both Android and iOS:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">flutter pub get\nflutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main\n</code></pre>\n<p>After installing the app either on a simulator, emulator, or a connected real-world device with <code>flutter run</code>, you’ll see that the app icon and the font family is set.</p>\n<p>You can use a small <code>r</code> in the CLI to reload the app and keep its state, and use a capital <code>R</code> to restart the application and drop its state. (This is needed when big changes are made in the structure. For example, a <code>StatelessWidget</code> gets converted into a stateful one; or when adding new dependencies and assets into your project.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"buildingthehomescreen\">Building the home screen</h2>\n<p>Before jumping right into coding, I always like to take my time and plan out how I’ll build that specific screen based on the screen designs. Let’s have another, closer look at the designs I made before writing them codez:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/11/shapeblinder-dart-flutter-game-design.png\" alt=\"Case Study: Building a Mobile Game with Dart and Flutter\"></p>\n<p>We can notice several things that will affect the project structure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>Home</code> and the <code>Lost</code> screen look very identical to each other</li>\n<li>All three screens have a shared <code>Logo</code> component with a title (shapeblinder / you lost) and a custom subtitle</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, let’s break down the <code>Home</code> and <code>Lost</code> screens a bit:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/11/sb-design-home-breakdown.png\" alt=\"Case Study: Building a Mobile Game with Dart and Flutter\"></p>\n<p>The first thing we’ll notice is that we’ll need to use a <strong>Column</strong> for the layout. (We may also think about the main and cross axis alignments - they are <code>center</code> and <code>start</code>, respectively. If you wouldn’t have known it by yourself, don’t worry - you’ll slowly develop a feeling for it. Until then, you can always experiment with all the options you have until you find the one that fits.)</p>\n<p>After that, we can notice the shared <code>Logo</code> or <code>Title</code> component and the shared <code>Tap</code> component. Also, the <code>Tap</code> component says “tap anywhere [on the screen] to start (again)”. To achieve this, we’ll wrap our layout in a <code>GestureDetector</code> so that the whole screen can respond to taps.</p>\n<p>Let’s hit up <code>Home.dart</code> and start implementing our findings. First, we set the background color in the Scaffold to black:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">return Scaffold(\n     backgroundColor: Colors.black,\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then, we can just go on and create the layout in the <code>body</code>. As I already mentioned, I’ll first wrap the whole body in a <code>GestureDetector</code>. It is a very important step because later on, we’ll just be able to add an <code>onTap</code> property, and we’ll be just fine navigating the user to the next screen.</p>\n<p>Inside the <code>GestureDetector</code>, however, I still won’t be adding the <code>Column</code> widget. First, I’ll wrap it in a <code>SafeArea</code> widget. <code>SafeArea</code> is a handy widget that adds additional padding to the UI if needed because of the hardware (for example, because of a notch, a swipeable bottom bar, or a camera cut-out). Then, inside that, I’ll also add in a <code>Padding</code> so that the UI can breathe, and inside that, will live our Column. The widget structure looks like this so far:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">Home\n├── Scaffold\n│   └── GestureDetector\n│   │   └── SafeArea\n│   │   │   └── Column\n</code></pre>\n<p>Oh, and by the way, just to flex with the awesome tooling of Flutter - you can always have a peek at how your widget structure looks like in the VS Code sidebar:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/11/VS-Code-sidebar-widget-structure-helper.png\" alt=\"Case Study: Building a Mobile Game with Dart and Flutter\"></p>\n<p>And this is how our code looks right now:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">import 'package:flutter/material.dart';\n \nclass Home extends StatelessWidget {\n @override\n Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n   return Scaffold(\n     backgroundColor: Colors.black,\n     body: GestureDetector(\n       // tapping on empty spaces would not trigger the onTap without this\n       behavior: HitTestBehavior.opaque,\n       onTap: () {\n         // navigate to the game screen\n       },\n       // SafeArea adds padding for device-specific reasons\n       // (e.g. bottom draggable bar on some iPhones, etc.)\n       child: SafeArea(\n         child: Padding(\n           padding: const EdgeInsets.all(40.0),\n           child: Column(\n             mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,\n             crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,\n             children: &lt;Widget&gt;[\n \n             ],\n           ),\n         ),\n       ),\n     ),\n   );\n }\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"creatinglayouttemplate\">Creating <code>Layout</code> template</h3>\n<p>And now, we have a nice frame or template for our screen. We’ll use the same template on all three screens of the app (excluding the <code>Game</code> screen where we won’t include a <code>GestureDetector</code>), and in cases like this, I always like to create a nice template widget for my screens. I’ll call this widget <code>Layout</code> now:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\"> // lib/ui/widgets/Layout.dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\n \nclass Layout extends StatelessWidget {\n // passing named parameters with the ({}) syntax\n // the type is automatically inferred from the type of the variable\n // (in this case, the children prop will have a type of List&lt;Widget&gt;)\n Layout({this.children});\n \n final List&lt;Widget&gt; children;\n \n @override\n Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n   return Scaffold(\n     backgroundColor: Colors.black,\n     // SafeArea adds padding for device-specific reasons\n     // (e.g. bottom draggable bar on some iPhones, etc.)\n     body: SafeArea(\n       child: Padding(\n         padding: const EdgeInsets.all(40.0),\n         child: Column(\n           mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,\n           crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,\n           children: children,\n         ),\n       ),\n     ),\n   );\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, in the <code>Home.dart</code>, we can just import this layout and wrap it in a GestureDetector, and we’ll have the very same result that we had previously, but we saved tons of lines of code because we can reuse this template on all other screens:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">import 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:flutter/services.dart';\n \nimport &quot;../widgets/Layout.dart&quot;;\n \nclass Home extends StatelessWidget {\n @override\n Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n   return GestureDetector(\n     // tapping on empty spaces would not trigger the onTap without this\n     behavior: HitTestBehavior.opaque,\n     onTap: () {\n       // navigate to the game screen\n     },\n     child: Layout(\n       children: &lt;Widget&gt;[\n \n       ],\n     ),\n   );\n }\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Oh, and remember this because it’s a nice rule of thumb: <strong>whenever you find yourself copying and pasting code from one widget to another, it’s time to extract that snippet into a separate widget.</strong> It really helps to keep spaghetti code away from your projects. 🍝</p>\n<p>Now that the overall wrapper and the GestureDetector is done, there are only a few things left on this screen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implementing the navigation in the <code>onTap</code> prop</li>\n<li>Building the <code>Logo</code> widget (with the title and subtitle)</li>\n<li>Building the <code>Tap</code> widget (with that circle-ey svg, title, and subtitle)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"implementingnavigation\">Implementing navigation</h3>\n<p>Inside the <code>GestureDetector</code>, we already have an <code>onTap</code> property set up, but the method itself is empty as of now. To get started with it, we should just throw in a <code>console.log</code>, or, as we say in Dart, a <code>print</code> statement to see if it responds to our taps.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">onTap: () {\n // navigate to the game screen\n print(&quot;hi!&quot;);\n},\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, if you run this code with <code>flutter run</code>, anytime you’ll tap the screen, you’ll see “hi!” being printed out into the console. (You’ll see it in the CLI.)</p>\n<p>That’s amazing! Now, let’s move forward to throwing in the navigation-related code. We already looked at navigation in the previous episode, and we already configured named routes in a previous step inside the <code>main.dart</code>, so we’ll have a relatively easy job now:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">onTap: () {\n // navigate to the game screen\n Navigator.pushNamed(context, &quot;/game&quot;);\n},\n</code></pre>\n<p>And boom, that’s it! Tapping anywhere on the screen will navigate the user to the game screen. However, because both screens are empty, you won’t really notice anything - so let’s build the two missing widgets!</p>\n<h3 id=\"buildingthelogowidgetheroanimationwithtextinflutter\">Building the Logo widget, Hero animation with text in Flutter</h3>\n<p>Let’s have another look at the <code>Logo</code> and the <code>Tap</code> widgets before we implement them:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/11/sb-widgets-breakdown.png\" alt=\"Case Study: Building a Mobile Game with Dart and Flutter\"></p>\n<p>We’ll start with the <code>Logo</code> widget because it’s easier to implement. First, we create an empty <code>StatelessWidget</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">// lib/ui/widgets/Logo.dart\nimport &quot;package:flutter/material.dart&quot;;\n \nclass Logo extends StatelessWidget {\n \n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then we define two properties, <code>title</code> and <code>subtitle</code>, with the method we already looked at in the <code>Layout</code> widget:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">import &quot;package:flutter/material.dart&quot;;\n \nclass Logo extends StatelessWidget {\n Logo({this.title, this.subtitle});\n \n final String title;\n final String subtitle;\n \n @override\n Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n  \n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And now, we can just return a <code>Column</code> from the <code>build</code> because we are looking forward to rendering two text widgets <strong>underneath each other</strong>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">@override\nWidget build(BuildContext context) {\n return Column(\n   crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,\n   children: &lt;Widget&gt;[\n     Text(\n       title,\n     ),\n     Text(\n       subtitle,\n     ),\n   ],\n );\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And notice how we were able to just use <code>title</code> and <code>subtitle</code> even though they are properties of the widget. We’ll also add in some text styling, and we’ll be done for now - with the main body.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">return Column(\n  crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,\n  children: &lt;Widget&gt;[\n    Text(\n      title,\n      style: TextStyle(\n        fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,\n        fontSize: 34.0,\n        color: Colors.white,\n      ),\n    ),\n    Text(\n      subtitle,\n      style: TextStyle(\n        fontSize: 24.0,\n        // The Color.xy[n] gets a specific shade of the color\n        color: Colors.grey[600],\n        fontStyle: FontStyle.italic,\n      ),\n    ),\n  ],\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now this is cool and good, and it matches what we wanted to accomplish - however, this widget could really use a nice finishing touch. Since this widget is shared between all of the screens, we could add a really cool <code>Hero</code> animation. The Hero animation is somewhat like the Magic Move in Keynote. Go ahead and watch this short Widget of The Week episode to know what a <code>Hero</code> animation is and how it works:</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Be9UH1kXFDw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>This is very cool, isn’t it? We’d imagine that just wrapping our Logo component in a <code>Hero</code> and passing a key would be enough, and we’d be right, but the <code>Text</code> widget’s styling is a bit odd in this case. First, we should wrap the <code>Column</code> in a <code>Hero</code> and pass in a key like the video said:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">return Hero(\n tag: &quot;title&quot;,\n transitionOnUserGestures: true,\n child: Column(\n   crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,\n   children: &lt;Widget&gt;[\n     Text(\n       title,\n       style: TextStyle(\n         fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,\n         fontSize: 34.0,\n         color: Colors.white,\n       ),\n     ),\n     Text(\n       subtitle,\n       style: TextStyle(\n         fontSize: 24.0,\n         // The Color.xy[n] gets a specific shade of the color\n         color: Colors.grey[600],\n         fontStyle: FontStyle.italic,\n       ),\n     ),\n   ],\n ),\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>But when the animation is happening, and the widgets are moving around, you’ll see that Flutter drops the font family and the <code>Text</code> overflows its container. So we’ll need to hack around Flutter with some additional components and theming data to make things work:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">import &quot;package:flutter/material.dart&quot;;\n \nclass Logo extends StatelessWidget {\n Logo({this.title, this.subtitle});\n \n final String title;\n final String subtitle;\n \n @override\n Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n   return Hero(\n     tag: &quot;title&quot;,\n     transitionOnUserGestures: true,\n     child: Material(\n       type: MaterialType.transparency,\n       child: Container(\n         width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width,\n         child: Column(\n           crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,\n           children: &lt;Widget&gt;[\n             Text(\n               title,\n               style: TextStyle(\n                 fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,\n                 fontSize: 34.0,\n                 color: Colors.white,\n               ),\n             ),\n             Text(\n               subtitle,\n               style: TextStyle(\n                 fontSize: 24.0,\n                 // The Color.xy[n] gets a specific shade of the color\n                 color: Colors.grey[600],\n                 fontStyle: FontStyle.italic,\n               ),\n             ),\n           ],\n         ),\n       ),\n     ),\n   );\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This code will ensure that the text has enough space even if the content changes between screens (which will of course happen), and that the font style doesn’t randomly change while in-flight (or while the animation is happening).</p>\n<p>Now, we’re finished with the Logo component, and it will work and animate perfectly and seamlessly between screens.</p>\n<h3 id=\"buildingthetapwidgetrenderingsvgsinflutter\">Building the Tap widget, rendering SVGs in Flutter</h3>\n<p>The <code>Tap</code> widget will render an SVG, a text from the props, and the high score from the stored state underneath each other. We could start by creating a new widget in the <code>lib/ui/widgets</code> directory. However, we’ll come to a dead-end after writing a few lines of code as Flutter doesn’t have native SVG rendering capabilities. Since we want to stick with SVGs instead of rendering them into PNGs, we’ll have to use a 3rd party package, <a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_svg\"><code>flutter_svg</code></a>.</p>\n<p>To install it, we just simply add it to the <code>pubspec.yaml</code> into the <code>dependencies</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">dependencies:\n flutter:\n   sdk: flutter\n \n cupertino_icons: ^0.1.3\n flutter_svg: any\n</code></pre>\n<p>And after saving the file, VS Code will automatically run <code>flutter pub get</code> and thus install the dependencies for you. Another great example of the powerful Flutter developer tooling! 🧙</p>\n<p>Now, we can just create a file under <code>lib/ui/widgets/Tap.dart</code>, import this dependency, and expect things to be going fine. If you were already running an instance of <code>flutter run</code>, you’ll need to restart the CLI when adding new packages (by hitting <code>Ctrl-C</code> to stop the current instance and running <code>flutter run</code> again):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">// lib/ui/widgets/Tap.dart\n \nimport &quot;package:flutter/material.dart&quot;;\n// import the dependency\nimport &quot;package:flutter_svg/flutter_svg.dart&quot;;\n</code></pre>\n<p>We’ll just start out with a simple <code>StatelessWidget</code> now, but we’ll refactor this widget later after we implemented storing the high scores! Until then, we only need to think about the layout: it’s a <code>Column</code> because children are <strong>underneath</strong> each other, but we wrap it into a <code>Center</code> so that it’s centered on the screen:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">import &quot;package:flutter/material.dart&quot;;\n// import the dependency\nimport &quot;package:flutter_svg/flutter_svg.dart&quot;;\n \nclass Tap extends StatelessWidget {\n @override\n Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n   return Center(\n     child: Column(\n       children: &lt;Widget&gt;[\n        \n       ],\n     ),\n   );\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now you may be wondering that setting the <code>crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center</code> in the <code>Column</code> would center the children of the column, so why the <code>Center</code> widget?</p>\n<p>The <code>crossAxisAlignment</code> only aligns children <strong>inside its parent’s bounds</strong>, but the <code>Column</code> doesn’t fill up the screen width. (You could, however, achieve this by using the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/CI7x0mAZiY0\"><code>Flexible</code></a> widget, but that would have some unexpected side effects.).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, <code>Center</code> aligns its children to the center of the screen. To understand why we need the <code>Center</code> widget and why setting <code>crossAxisAlignment</code> to center isn’t just enough, I made a little illustration:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/11/sb-alignment-breakdown.png\" alt=\"Case Study: Building a Mobile Game with Dart and Flutter\"></p>\n<p>Now that this is settled, we can define the properties of this widget:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\"> Tap({this.title});\n final String title;\n</code></pre>\n<p>And move on to building the layout. First comes the SVG - the <code>flutter_svg</code> package exposes an <code>SvgPicture.asset</code> method that will return a Widget and hence can be used in the widget tree, but that widget will always try to fill up its ancestor, so we need to restrict the size of it. We can use either a <code>SizedBox</code> or a <code>Container</code> for this purpose. It’s up to you:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">Container(\n height: 75,\n child: SvgPicture.asset(\n   &quot;assets/svg/tap.svg&quot;,\n   semanticsLabel: 'tap icon',\n ),\n),\n</code></pre>\n<p>And we’ll just render the two other texts (the one that comes from the props and the best score) underneath each other, leaving us to this code:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">import &quot;package:flutter/material.dart&quot;;\n// import the dependency\nimport &quot;package:flutter_svg/flutter_svg.dart&quot;;\n \nclass Tap extends StatelessWidget {\n Tap({this.title});\n final String title;\n \n @override\n Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n   return Center(\n     child: Column(\n       children: &lt;Widget&gt;[\n         Container(\n           height: 75,\n           child: SvgPicture.asset(\n             &quot;assets/svg/tap.svg&quot;,\n             semanticsLabel: 'tap icon',\n           ),\n         ),\n         // give some space between the illustration and the text:\n         Container(\n           height: 14,\n         ),\n         Text(\n           title,\n           style: TextStyle(\n             fontSize: 18.0,\n             color: Colors.grey[600],\n           ),\n         ),\n         Text(\n           &quot;best score: 0&quot;,\n           style: TextStyle(\n             fontSize: 18.0,\n             color: Colors.grey[600],\n             fontStyle: FontStyle.italic,\n           ),\n         ),\n       ],\n     ),\n   );\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Always take your time examining the code examples provided</strong>, as you’ll soon start writing code just like this.</p>\n<h3 id=\"puttingitalltogetherintothefinalhomescreen\">Putting it all together into the final Home screen</h3>\n<p>Now that all two widgets are ready to be used on our <code>Home</code> and <code>Lost</code> screens, we should get back to the <code>Home.dart</code> and start putting them together into a cool screen.</p>\n<p>First, we should import these classes we just made:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">// lib/ui/screens/Home.dart\n \nimport &quot;../widgets/Layout.dart&quot;;\n// ADD THIS:\nimport &quot;../widgets/Logo.dart&quot;;\nimport &quot;../widgets/Tap.dart&quot;;\n</code></pre>\n<p>And inside the <code>Layout</code>, we already have a blank space as children, we should just fill it up with our new, shiny components:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">import 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:flutter/services.dart';\n \nimport &quot;../widgets/Layout.dart&quot;;\nimport &quot;../widgets/Logo.dart&quot;;\nimport &quot;../widgets/Tap.dart&quot;;\n \nclass Home extends StatelessWidget {\n @override\n Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n   return GestureDetector(\n     // tapping on empty spaces would not trigger the onTap without this\n     behavior: HitTestBehavior.opaque,\n     onTap: () {\n       // navigate to the game screen\n       HapticFeedback.lightImpact();\n       Navigator.pushNamed(context, &quot;/game&quot;);\n     },\n     child: Layout(\n       children: &lt;Widget&gt;[\n         Logo(\n           title: &quot;shapeblinder&quot;,\n           subtitle: &quot;a game with the lights off&quot;,\n         ),\n         Tap(\n           title: &quot;tap anywhere to start&quot;,\n         ),\n       ],\n     ),\n   );\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And boom! After reloading the app, you’ll see that the new widgets are on-screen. There’s only one more thing left: the alignment is a bit off on this screen, and it doesn’t really match the design. Because of that, we’ll add in some <code>Spacer</code>s.</p>\n<p>In Flutter, a <code>Spacer</code> is your <code>&lt;div style={{ flex: 1 }}/&gt;</code>, except that they are not considered to be a weird practice here. Their sole purpose is to fill up every pixel of empty space on a screen, and we can also provide them a <code>flex</code> value if we want one <code>Spacer</code> to be larger than another.</p>\n<p>In our case, this is exactly what we need: we’ll need one large spacer before the logo and a smaller one after the logo:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">Spacer(\n flex: 2,\n),\n// add hero cross-screen animation for title\nLogo(\n title: &quot;shapeblinder&quot;,\n subtitle: &quot;a game with the lights off&quot;,\n),\nSpacer(),\nTap(\n title: &quot;tap anywhere to start&quot;,\n),\n</code></pre>\n<p>And this will push everything into place.</p>\n<h2 id=\"buildingthelostscreenpassingpropertiestoscreensinflutterwithnavigator\">Building the <code>Lost</code> screen, passing properties to screens in Flutter with Navigator</h2>\n<p>Because the layout of the <code>Lost</code> screen is an exact copy of the <code>Home</code> screen except some differences here and there, we’ll just copy and paste the <code>Home.dart</code> into the <code>Lost.dart</code> and modify it like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">class Lost extends StatelessWidget {\n @override\n Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n   return GestureDetector(\n     behavior: HitTestBehavior.opaque,\n     onTap: () {\n       // navigate to the game screen\n       Navigator.pop(context);\n     },\n     child: Layout(\n       children: &lt;Widget&gt;[\n         Spacer(\n           flex: 2,\n         ),\n         Logo(\n           title: &quot;you lost&quot;,\n           subtitle: &quot;score: 0&quot;,\n         ),\n         Spacer(),\n         Tap(\n           title: &quot;tap anywhere to start again&quot;,\n         ),\n       ],\n     ),\n   );\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, this just won’t be enough for us now. As you can see, there is a hard-coded “score: 0” on the screen. We want to pass the score as a prop to this screen, and display that value here.</p>\n<p>To pass properties to a named route in Flutter, you should create an arguments class. In this case, we’ll name it <code>LostScreenArguments</code>. Because we only want to pass an integer (the points of the user), this class will be relatively simple:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">// passing props to this screen with arguments\n// you'll need to construct this class in the sender screen, to\n// (in our case, the Game.dart)\nclass LostScreenArguments {\n final int points;\n \n LostScreenArguments(this.points);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And we can extract the arguments inside the <code>build</code> method:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">@override\nWidget build(BuildContext context) {\n // extract the arguments from the previously discussed class\n final LostScreenArguments args = ModalRoute.of(context).settings.arguments;\n // you'll be able to access it by: args.points\n</code></pre>\n<p>And just use the <code>${...}</code>string interpolation method in the <code>Text</code> widget to display the score from the arguments:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">Logo(\n title: &quot;you lost&quot;,\n // string interpolation with the ${} syntax\n subtitle: &quot;score: ${args.points}&quot;,\n),\n</code></pre>\n<p>And boom, that’s all the code needed for <strong>receiving</strong> arguments on a screen! We’ll look into passing them later on when we are building the Game screen…</p>\n<h2 id=\"buildingtheunderlyinggamelogic\">Building the underlying Game logic</h2>\n<p>...which we’ll start right now. So far, this is what we’ve built and what we didn’t implement yet:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>✅ Logo widget</em>\n<ul>\n<li><em>✅ Hero animation</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>✅ Tap widget</em>\n<ul>\n<li><em>✅ Rendering SVGs</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>✅ Home screen</em></li>\n<li><em>✅ Lost screen</em>\n<ul>\n<li><em>✅ Passing props</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Underlying game logic</li>\n<li>Game screen</li>\n<li>Drawing shapes</li>\n<li>Using haptic feedback</li>\n<li>Storing high scores - persistent data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So there’s still a lot to learn! 🎓First, we’ll build the underlying game logic and classes. Then, we’ll build the layout for the Game screen. After that, we’ll draw shapes on the screen that will be tappable. We’ll hook them into our logic, add in haptic feedback, and after that, we’ll just store and retrieve the high scores, test the game on a real device, and our game is going to be ready for production!</p>\n<p>The underlying game logic will pick three random shapes for the user to show, and it will also pick one correct solution. To pass around this generated data, first, we’ll create a class named <code>RoundData</code> inside the <code>lib/core/RoundUtilities.dart</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">class RoundData {\n List&lt;String&gt; options;\n int correct;\n \n RoundData({this.options, this.correct});\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Inside the <code>assets/svg</code> directory, we have some shapes lying around. We’ll store the names of the files in an array of strings so that we can pick random strings from this list:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">// import these!!\nimport 'dart:core';\nimport 'dart:math';\n \nclass RoundData {\n List&lt;String&gt; options;\n int correct;\n \n RoundData({this.options, this.correct});\n}\n \n// watch out - new code below!\nRandom random = new Random();\n \n// the names represent all the shapes in the assets/svg directory\nfinal List&lt;String&gt; possible = [\n &quot;circle&quot;,\n &quot;cross&quot;,\n &quot;donut&quot;,\n &quot;line&quot;,\n &quot;oval&quot;,\n &quot;square&quot;\n];\n</code></pre>\n<p>And notice that I also created a new instance of the <code>Random</code> class and imported a few native Dart libraries. We can use this <code>random</code> variable to get new random numbers between two values:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">// this will generate a new random int between 0 and 5\nrandom.nextInt(5);\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>The <code>nextInt</code>’s upper bound is exclusive, meaning that the code above can result in 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, but not 5.</em></p>\n<p>To get a random item from an array, we can combine the <code>.length</code> property with this random number generator method:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">int randomItemIndex = random.nextInt(array.length);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, I’ll write a method that will return a <code>RoundData</code> instance:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">RoundData generateRound() {\n // new temporary possibility array\n // we can remove possibilities from it\n // so that the same possibility doesn't come up twice\n List&lt;String&gt; temp = possible.map((item) =&gt; item).toList();\n \n // we'll store possibilities in this array\n List&lt;String&gt; res = new List&lt;String&gt;();\n \n // add three random shapes from the temp possibles to the options\n for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n   // get random index from the temporary array\n   int randomItemIndex = random.nextInt(temp.length);\n \n   // add the randomth item of the temp array to the results\n   res.add(temp[randomItemIndex]);\n \n   // remove possibility from the temp array so that it doesn't come up twice\n   temp.removeAt(randomItemIndex);\n }\n \n // create new RoundData instance that we'll be able to return\n RoundData data = RoundData(\n   options: res,\n   correct: random.nextInt(3),\n );\n \n return data;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Take your time reading the code with the comments and make sure that you understand the hows and whys.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gamescreen\">Game screen</h2>\n<p>Now that we have the underlying game logic in the <code>lib/core/RoundUtilities.dart</code>, let’s navigate back into the <code>lib/ui/screens/Game.dart</code> and import the utilities we just created:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">import 'package:flutter/material.dart';\n \n// import this:\nimport '../../core/RoundUtilities.dart';\nimport &quot;../widgets/Layout.dart&quot;;\nimport &quot;../widgets/Logo.dart&quot;;\n</code></pre>\n<p>And since we’d like to update this screen regularly (whenever a new round is generated), we should convert the <code>Game</code> class into a <code>StatefulWidget</code>. We can achieve this with a VS Code shortcut (right-click on class definition &gt; Refactor… &gt; Convert to StatefulWidget):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">class Game extends StatefulWidget {\n @override\n _GameState createState() =&gt; _GameState();\n}\n \nclass _GameState extends State&lt;Game&gt; {\n @override\n Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n   return Layout(\n     children: &lt;Widget&gt;[\n       Logo(\n         title: &quot;shapeblinder&quot;,\n         subtitle: &quot;current score: 0 | high: 0&quot;,\n       ),\n     ],\n   );\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And now, we’ll build the layout. Let’s take a look at the mock for this screen:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/11/sb-game-design-breakdown.png\" alt=\"Case Study: Building a Mobile Game with Dart and Flutter\"></p>\n<p>Our screen already contains the shared Logo widget, and we’ll work with drawing shapes a bit later, so we’ll only have to cover</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proper spacing with <code>Spacer</code>s</li>\n<li>Creating a container for our shape</li>\n<li>Drawing the three possible shapes on the bottom of the screen</li>\n<li>Hooking them up to a tap handler</li>\n<li>If the guess is correct, show a <code>SnackBar</code> and create a new round</li>\n<li>If the guess in incorrect, end the session and navigate the user to the lost screen</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"initializingdataflow\">Initializing data flow</h3>\n<p>So let’s get started! First, I’ll define the variables inside the state. Since this is a <code>StatefulWidget</code>, we can just define some variables inside the <code>State</code> and expect them to be hooked up to Flutter’s inner state management engine.</p>\n<p>I’d also like to give them some values., so I’ll create a <code>reset</code> method. It will set the points to zero and create a new round with the generator we created previously. We’ll run this method when the <code>initState</code> method runs so that the screen is initialized with game data:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">class _GameState extends State&lt;Game&gt; {\n RoundData data;\n int points = 0;\n int high = 0;\n final GlobalKey scaffoldKey = GlobalKey();\n \n// the initState method is ran by Flutter when the element is first time painted\n// it's like componentDidMount in React\n @override\n void initState() {\n   reset();\n   super.initState();\n }\n \n void reset() {\n   setState(() {\n     points = 0;\n     data = generateRound();\n   });\n }\n \n ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>And now, we can move on to defining our layout:</p>\n<h3 id=\"initializingtheui\">Initializing the UI</h3>\n<p>Now that we have some data we can play around with, we can create the overall layout of this screen. First, I’ll create a runtime constant (or a <code>final</code>) I’ll call <code>width</code>. It will contain the available screen width:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">@override\nWidget build(BuildContext context) {\n final width = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width;\n</code></pre>\n<p>I can use this to create a perfect square container for the shape that we’ll render later:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">Container(\n height: width / 1.25,\n width: width / 1.25,\n),\n</code></pre>\n<p>After this comes a simple centered text:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">Center(\n child: Text(\n   &quot;select the shape that you feel&quot;,\n   style: TextStyle(\n     fontSize: 18.0,\n     color: Colors.grey[600],\n     fontStyle: FontStyle.italic,\n   ),\n ),\n),\n</code></pre>\n<p>And we’ll draw out the three possible shapes in a <code>Row</code> because they are positioned next to each other. First, I’ll just define the container:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">Row(\n mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween,\n children: &lt;Widget&gt;[   \n  \n ],\n),\n</code></pre>\n<p>And we can use the state’s <code>RoundData</code> instance, <code>data</code>, to know which three possible shapes we need to render out. We can just simply map over it and use the spread operator to pass the results into the Row:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">...data.options.map(\n (e) =&gt; Container(\n   height: width / 5,\n   width: width / 5,\n   child: GestureDetector(\n     onTap: () =&gt; guess(context, e),\n     child: SvgPicture.asset(\n       &quot;assets/svg/$e.svg&quot;,\n       semanticsLabel: '$e icon',\n     ),\n   ),\n ),\n),\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will map over the three possibilities in the state, render their corresponding icons in a sized container, and add a <code>GestureDetector</code> to it so that we can know when the user taps on the shape (or when the user makes a guess). For the <code>guess</code> method, we’ll pass the current <code>BuildContext</code> and the name of the shape the user had just tapped on. We’ll look into why the context is needed in a bit, but first, let’s just define a boilerplate void and print out the name of the shape the user tapped:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">void guess(BuildContext context, String name) {\n print(name);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, we can determine if the guess is correct or not by comparing this string to the one under <code>data.options[data.correct]</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">void guess(BuildContext context, String name) {\n if (data.options[data.correct] == name) {\n   // correct guess!\n   correctGuess(context);\n } else {\n   // wrong guess\n   lost();\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And we should also create a <code>correctGuess</code> and a <code>lost</code> handler:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">void correctGuess(BuildContext context) {\n // show snackbar\n Scaffold.of(context).showSnackBar(\n   SnackBar(\n     backgroundColor: Colors.green,\n     duration: Duration(seconds: 1),\n     content: Column(\n       mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,\n       crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,\n       children: &lt;Widget&gt;[\n         Icon(\n           Icons.check,\n           size: 80,\n         ),\n         Container(width: 10),\n         Text(\n           &quot;Correct!&quot;,\n           style: TextStyle(\n             fontSize: 24,\n             fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,\n           ),\n         ),\n       ],\n     ),\n   ),\n );\n \n // add one point, generate new round\n setState(() {\n   points++;\n   data = generateRound();\n });\n}\n \nvoid lost() {\n // navigate the user to the lost screen\n Navigator.pushNamed(\n   context,\n   &quot;/lost&quot;,\n   // pass arguments with this constructor:\n   arguments: LostScreenArguments(points),\n );\n \n // reset the game so that when the user comes back from the &quot;lost&quot; screen,\n // a new, fresh round is ready\n reset();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>There’s something special about the <code>correctGuess</code> block: the <code>Scaffold.of(context)</code> will look up the <code>Scaffold</code> widget in the context. However, the <code>context</code> we are currently passing comes from the <code>build(BuildContext context)</code> line, and that context doesn’t contain a Scaffold yet. We can create a new <code>BuildContext</code> by either extracting the widget into another widget (which we won’t be doing now), or by wrapping the widget in a <code>Builder</code>.</p>\n<p>So I’ll wrap the <code>Row</code> with the icons in a <code>Builder</code> and I’ll also throw in an <code>Opacity</code> so that the icons have a nice gray color instead of being plain white:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">Builder(\n builder: (context) =&gt; Opacity(\n   opacity: 0.2,\n   child: Row(\n     mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween,\n     children: &lt;Widget&gt;[\n       ...data.options.map(\n</code></pre>\n<p>And now, when tapping on the shapes on the bottom, the user will either see a full-screen green snackbar with a check icon and the text “Correct!”, or find themselves on the “Lost” screen. Great! Now, there’s only one thing left before we can call our app a game - drawing the tappable shape on the screen.</p>\n<h2 id=\"drawingtouchableshapesinflutter\">Drawing touchable shapes in Flutter</h2>\n<p>Now that we have the core game logic set up and we have a nice Game screen we can draw on, it’s time to get dirty with drawing on a canvas. Whilst we could use Flutter’s native drawing capabilities, we’d lack a very important feature  - interactivity.</p>\n<p>Lucky for us, there’s a package that despite having a bit limited drawing capabilities, has support for interactivity - and it’s called <a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/touchable\">touchable</a>. Let’s just add it into our dependencies in the <code>pubspec.yaml</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">touchable: any\n</code></pre>\n<p>And now, a few words about how we’re going to achieve drawing shapes. I’ll create some custom painters inside <code>lib/core/shapepainters</code>. They will extend the <code>CustomPainter</code> class that comes from the <code>touchable</code> library. Each of these painters will be responsible for drawing a single shape (e.g. a circle, a line, or a square). I won’t be inserting the code required for all of them inside the article. Instead, you can check it out <a href=\"https://github.com/RisingStack/shapeblinder/tree/master/lib/core/shapepainters\">inside the repository here</a>.</p>\n<p>Then, inside the <code>RoundUtilities.dart</code>, we’ll have a method that will return the corresponding painter for the string name of it - e.g. if we pass “circle”, we’ll get the <code>Circle CustomPainter</code>.</p>\n<p>We’ll be able to use this method in the <code>Game</code> screen, and we’ll pass the result of this method to the <code>CustomPaint</code> widget coming from the <code>touchable</code> package. This widget will paint the shape on a canvas and add the required interactivity.</p>\n<h3 id=\"creatingacustompainter\">Creating a CustomPainter</h3>\n<p>Let’s get started! First, let’s look at one of the <code>CustomPainter</code>s (the other ones only differ in the type of shape they draw on the canvas, so we won’t look into them). First, we’ll initialize an empty <code>CustomPainter</code> with the default methods and two properties, <code>context</code> and <code>onTap</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">import 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:touchable/touchable.dart';\n \nclass Square extends CustomPainter {\n final BuildContext context;\n final Function onTap;\n \n Square(this.context, this.onTap);\n \n @override\n void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {\n }\n \n @override\n bool shouldRepaint(CustomPainter oldDelegate) {\n   return false;\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We’ll use the <code>context</code> later when creating the canvas, and the <code>onTap</code> will be the tap handler for our shape. Now, inside the <code>paint</code> overridden method, we can create a <code>TouchyCanvas</code> coming from the package:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">var myCanvas = TouchyCanvas(context, canvas);\n</code></pre>\n<p>And draw on it with the built-in methods:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">myCanvas.drawRect(\n Rect.fromLTRB(\n   0,\n   0,\n   MediaQuery.of(context).size.width / 1.25,\n   MediaQuery.of(context).size.width / 1.25,\n ),\n Paint()..color = Colors.transparent,\n onTapDown: (tapdetail) {\n   onTap();\n },\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will create a simple rectangle. The arguments in the <code>Rect.fromLTRB</code> define the coordinates of the two points between which the rect will be drawn. It’s <code>0, 0</code> and <code>width / 1.25, width / 1.25</code> for our shape - this will fill in the container we created on the Game screen.</p>\n<p>We also pass a transparent color (so that the shape is hidden) and an <code>onTapDown</code>, which will just run the <code>onTap</code> property which we pass. Noice!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/KxiRwO7tqXCTDVKobo/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Case Study: Building a Mobile Game with Dart and Flutter\"></p>\n<p>This is it for drawing our square shape. I created the other <code>CustomPainter</code> classes that we’ll need for drawing a circle, cross, donut, line, oval, and square shapes. You could either try to implement them yourself, or just copy and paste them from <a href=\"https://github.com/RisingStack/shapeblinder/tree/master/lib/core/shapepainters\">the repository here</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"drawingthepainteronthescreen\">Drawing the painter on the screen</h3>\n<p>Now that our painters are ready, we can move on to the second step: the <code>getPainterForName</code> method. First, I’ll import all the painters into the <code>RoundUtilities.dart</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">import 'shapepainters/Circle.dart';\nimport 'shapepainters/Cross.dart';\nimport 'shapepainters/Donut.dart';\nimport 'shapepainters/Line.dart';\nimport 'shapepainters/Oval.dart';\nimport 'shapepainters/Square.dart';\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then just write a very simple switch statement that will return the corresponding painter for the input string:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">dynamic getPainterForName(BuildContext context, Function onTap, String name) {\n switch (name) {\n   case &quot;circle&quot;:\n     return Circle(context, onTap);\n   case &quot;cross&quot;:\n     return Cross(context, onTap);\n   case &quot;donut&quot;:\n     return Donut(context, onTap);\n   case &quot;line&quot;:\n     return Line(context, onTap);\n   case &quot;oval&quot;:\n     return Oval(context, onTap);\n   case &quot;square&quot;:\n     return Square(context, onTap);\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And that’s it for the utilities! Now, we can move back into the Game screen and use this <code>getPainterForName</code> utility and the canvas to draw the shapes on the screen:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">Container(\n height: width / 1.25,\n width: width / 1.25,\n child: CanvasTouchDetector(\n   builder: (context) {\n     return CustomPaint(\n       painter: getPainterForName(\n         context,\n         onShapeTap,\n         data.options[data.correct],\n       ),\n     );\n   },\n ),\n),\n</code></pre>\n<p>And that’s it! We only need to create an <code>onShapeTap</code> handler to get all these things working - for now, it’s okay to just throw in a <code>print</code> statement, and we’ll add the haptic feedbacks and the vibrations later on:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">void onShapeTap() {\n print(\n   &quot;the user has tapped inside the shape. we should make a gentle haptic feedback!&quot;,\n );\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And now, when you tap on the shape inside the blank space, the Flutter CLI will pop up this message in the console. Awesome! We only need to add the haptic feedback, store the high scores, and wrap things up from now on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"addinghapticfeedbackandvibrationinflutter\">Adding haptic feedback and vibration in Flutter</h2>\n<p>When making mobile applications, you should always aim for designing native experiences on both platforms. That means using different designs for Android and iOS, and using the platform’s native capabilities like Google Pay / Apple Pay or 3D Touch. To be able to think about which designs and experiences feel native on different platforms, you should use both platforms while developing, or at least be able to try out them sometimes.</p>\n<p>One of the places where Android and iOS devices differ is how they handle vibrations. While Android has a basic vibration capability, iOS comes with a very extensive haptic feedback engine that enables creating gentle hit-like feedback, with custom intensities, curves, mimicking the 3D Touch effect, tapback and more. It helps the user <em>feel</em> their actions, taps, and gestures, and as a developer, it’s a very nice finishing touch for your app to add some gentle haptic feedback to your app. It will help the user feel your app native and make the overall experience better.</p>\n<p>Some places where you can try out this advanced haptic engine on an iPhone (6s or later) are the home screen when 3D Touching an app, the Camera app when taking a photo, the Clock app when picking out an alarm time (or any other carousel picker), some iMessage effects, or on notched iPhones, when opening the app switcher from the bottom bar. Other third party apps also feature gentle physical feedback: for example, the Telegram app makes a nice and gentle haptic feedback when sliding for a reply.</p>\n<p>Before moving on with this tutorial, you may want to try out this effect to get a feeling of what we are trying to achieve on iOS - and make sure that you are holding the device in your whole palm so that you can feel the gentle tapbacks.</p>\n<p>In our app, we’d like to add these gentle haptic feedbacks in a lot of places: when navigating, making a guess, or, obviously, when tapping inside the shape. On Android, we’ll only leverage the vibration engine when the user taps inside a shape or loses.</p>\n<p>And since we’d like to execute different code based on which platform the app is currently running on, we need a way to check the current platform in the runtime. Lucky for us, the <code>dart:io</code> provides us with a <code>Platform</code> API that we can ask if the current platform is iOS or Android. We can use the <code>HapticFeedback</code> API from the <code>flutter/services.dart</code> to call the native haptic feedback and vibration APIs:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">// lib/core/HapticUtilities.dart\n \nimport 'dart:io' show Platform;\nimport 'package:flutter/services.dart';\n \nvoid lightHaptic() {\n if (Platform.isIOS) {\n   HapticFeedback.lightImpact();\n }\n}\n \nvoid vibrateHaptic() {\n if (Platform.isIOS) {\n   HapticFeedback.heavyImpact();\n } else {\n   // this will work on most Android devices\n   HapticFeedback.vibrate();\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And we can now import this file on other screens and use the <code>lightHaptic</code> and <code>vibrateHaptic</code> methods to make haptic feedback for the user that works on both platforms that we’re targeting:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">// lib/ui/screens/Game.dart\nimport '../../core/HapticUtilities.dart'; // ADD THIS LINE\n \n...\n \nvoid guess(BuildContext context, String name) {\n   lightHaptic(); // ADD THIS LINE\n \n...\n \nvoid lost() {\n   vibrateHaptic(); // ADD THIS LINE\n \n...\n \nContainer(\n height: width / 1.25,\n width: width / 1.25,\n child: CanvasTouchDetector(\n   builder: (context) {\n     return CustomPaint(\n       painter: getPainterForName(\n         context,\n         vibrateHaptic, // CHANGE THIS LINE\n \n</code></pre>\n<p>And on the <code>Home</code> and <code>Lost</code> screens:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">// Home.dart\n// Home.dart\nreturn GestureDetector(\n // tapping on empty spaces would not trigger the onTap without this\n behavior: HitTestBehavior.opaque,\n onTap: () {\n   // navigate to the game screen\n   lightHaptic(); // ADD THIS LINE\n   Navigator.pushNamed(context, &quot;/game&quot;);\n },\n \n...\n \n// Lost.dart\nreturn GestureDetector(\n behavior: HitTestBehavior.opaque,\n onTap: () {\n   // navigate to the game screen\n   lightHaptic(); // ADD THIS LINE\n   Navigator.pop(context);\n },\n</code></pre>\n<p>...aaaaand you’re done for iOS! On Android, there’s still a small thing required - you need permission for using the vibration engine, and you can ask for permission from the system in the <code>shapeblinder/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-xml\">&lt;manifest ...&gt;\n &lt;uses-permission android:name=&quot;android.permission.VIBRATE&quot;/&gt;\n ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now when running the app on a physical device, you’ll feel either the haptic feedback or the vibration, depending on what kind of device you’re using. Isn’t it amazing? You can literally feel your code!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/tUMbQNPT9SbHG/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Case Study: Building a Mobile Game with Dart and Flutter\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"storinghighscoresdatapersistencyinflutter\">Storing high scores - data persistency in Flutter</h2>\n<p>There’s just one new feature left before we finish the MVP of this awesome game. The users are now happy - they can feel a sense of accomplishment when they guess right, and they get points, but they can’t really flex with their highest score for their friends as we don’t store them. We should fix this by storing persistent data in Flutter! 💪</p>\n<p>To achieve this, we’ll use the <a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences\"><code>shared_preferences</code></a> package. It can store simple key/value pairs on the device. You should already know what to do with this dependency: go into <code>pubspec.yaml</code>, add it into the deps, wait until VS Code runs the <code>flutter pub get</code> command automatically or run it by yourself, and then restart the current Flutter session by hitting <code>Ctrl + C</code> and running <code>flutter run</code> again.</p>\n<p>Now that the <code>shared_preferences</code> package is injected, we can start using it. The package has two methods that we’ll take use of now: <code>.getInt()</code> and <code>.setInt()</code>. This is how we’ll implement them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We’ll store the high score when the user loses the game</li>\n<li>We’ll retrieve it in the <code>Tap</code> widget, and on the <code>Game</code> screen</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s get started by storing the high score! Inside the <code>lib/ui/screens/Game.dart</code>, we’ll create two methods: <code>loadHigh</code> and <code>setHigh</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">void loadHigh() async {\n SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();\n \n setState(() {\n   high = prefs.getInt('high') ?? 0;\n });\n}\n \nvoid setHigh(int pts) async {\n SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();\n prefs.setInt('high', pts);\n \n setState(() {\n   high = pts;\n });\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And because we’re displaying the high score in the Logo widget, we’ll want to call <code>setState</code> when the score is updated - so that the widget gets re-rendered with our new data. We’ll also want to call the <code>loadHigh</code> when the screen gets rendered the first time - so that we’re displaying the actual stored high score for the user:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">// the initState method is ran by Flutter when the element is first time painted\n// it's like componentDidMount in React\n@override\nvoid initState() {\n reset();\n loadHigh(); // ADD THIS\n super.initState();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And when the user loses, we’ll store the high score:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\"> void lost() {\n   vibrateHaptic();\n \n   // if the score is higher than the current high score,\n   // update the high score\n   if (points &gt; high) {\n     setHigh(points);\n   }\n \n   ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>And that’s it for the game screen! We’ll also want to load the high score on the <code>Tap</code> widget, which - currently - is a <code>StatelessWidget</code>. First, let’s refactor the <code>Tap</code> widget into a <code>StatefulWidget</code> by right-clicking on the name of the class, hitting “Refactor…”, and then “Convert to StatefulWidget”.</p>\n<p>Then, define the state variables and use the very same methodology we already looked at to load the high score and update the state:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">class _TapState extends State&lt;Tap&gt; {\n int high = 0;\n \n void loadHigh() async {\n   SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();\n \n   setState(() {\n     high = prefs.getInt('high') ?? 0;\n   });\n }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, call this <code>loadHigh</code> method inside the <code>build</code> so that the widget is always caught up on the latest new high score:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">@override\nWidget build(BuildContext context) {\n loadHigh();\n \n return Center(\n   ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Oh, and we should also replace the hard-coded <code>“high score: 0”</code>s with the actual variable that represents the high score:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">Text(\n &quot;best score: $high&quot;,\n</code></pre>\n<p>Make sure that you update your code <strong>both in the Game and the Tap widgets</strong>. We’re all set now with storing and displaying the high score now, so there’s only one thing left:</p>\n<h2 id=\"summingourdartandflutterseriesup\">Summing our Dart and Flutter series up</h2>\n<p>Congratulations! 🎉 I can’t really explain with words how far we’ve come into the whole Dart and Flutter ecosystem in these three episodes together:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/learn-dart-language-beginner-tutorial/\">First, we looked at Dart and OOP</a>:</strong> We looked at variables, constants, functions, arrays, objects, object-oriented programming, and asynchrony, and compared these concepts to what we’ve seen in JavaScript.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/flutter-crash-course-javascript/\">Then, we started with some Flutter theory</a>:</strong> We took a peek at the Flutter CLI, project structuring, state management, props, widgets, layouts, rendering lists, theming, and proper networking.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Then we created a pretty amazing game together:</strong> We built a cross-platform game from scratch.

I’m glad you’re here again for some more Dart and Flutter magic.</p>\n<p>✨ In the previous episode of this series, <a href=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/learn-dart-language-beginner-tutorial/\">we looked at Dart and went from basically zero to hero</a> with all those types, classes and asynchrony. I hope you had enough practice on Dart because today, we’ll move forward to Flutter. Let’s get started!</p>\n<p><em>Quick heads up: the  “👉” emoji will compare JS and React with Dart and Flutter language examples as of now. Just like in the previous episode,, the left side will be the JS/React, and the right side will be the Dart/Flutter equivalent, e.g. <code>console.log(&quot;hi!&quot;);</code> 👉 <code>print(&quot;hello!&quot;);</code></em></p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisflutterandwhywelluseit\">What is Flutter, and why we’ll use it</h2>\n<p>Flutter and Dart are both made by Google. While Dart is a programming language, Flutter is a UI toolkit that can compile to native Android and iOS code. Flutter has experimental web and desktop app support, and it’s the native framework for building apps for Google’s Fuchsia OS.</p>\n<p>This means that you don’t need to worry about the platform, and you can focus on the product itself. The compiled app is always native code as Dart compiles to ARM, hence providing you the best cross-platform performance you can get right now with over 60 fps.</p>\n<p>Flutter also helps the fast development cycle with stateful hot reload, which we’ll make use of mostly in the last episode of this series.</p>\n<h2 id=\"introtothefluttercli\">Intro to the Flutter CLI</h2>\n<p>When building apps with Flutter, one of the main tools on your belt is the Flutter CLI. With the CLI, you can create new Flutter projects, run tests on them, build them, and run them on your simulators or emulators. The CLI is available on <a href=\"https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows\">Windows</a>, <a href=\"https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/linux\">Linux</a>, <a href=\"https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos\">macOS</a> and <a href=\"https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/chromeos\">x64-based ChromeOS</a> systems.</p>\n<p>Once you have the CLI installed, you’ll also need either <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio\">Android Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/xcode/\">Xcode</a>, or both, depending on your desired target platform(s).</p>\n<p>(Flutter is also available on the web and for desktop, but they are still experimental, so this tutorial will only cover the Android and iOS related parts).</p>\n<p>If you don’t wish to use Android Studio for development, I recommend VSCode. You can also install the <a href=\"https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor?tab=vscode\">Dart and Flutter plugins</a> for Visual Studio Code.</p>\n<p>Once you’re all set with all these new software, you should be able to run <code>flutter doctor</code>. This utility will check if everything is working properly on your machine. At the time of writing, Flutter printed this into the console for me:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">[✓] Flutter (Channel stable, v1.17.4, on Mac OS X 10.15.4 19E287, locale en-HU)\n\n[✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 29.0.2)\n[✓] Xcode - develop for iOS and macOS (Xcode 11.5)\n[!] Android Studio (version 3.5)\n    ✗ Flutter plugin not installed; this adds Flutter specific functionality.\n    ✗ Dart plugin not installed; this adds Dart specific functionality.\n[✓] VS Code (version 1.46.1)\n[!] Connected device\n    ! No devices available\n</code></pre>\n<p>You should get similar results for at least for the Flutter part too. Everything else depends on your desired target platforms and your preferred IDEs like Android Studio or VS Code. If you get an <code>X</code> for something, check again if everything is set up properly.</p>\n<p><strong>Only move forward in this tutorial if everything works properly.</strong></p>\n<p>To create a new Flutter project, cd into your preferred working directory, and run <code>flutter create &lt;projectname&gt;</code>. The CLI will create a directory and place the project files in there. If you use VS Code on macOS with an iOS target, you can use this little snippet to speed up your development process:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\"># Create a new project\nflutter create &lt;projectname&gt;\n\n# move there\ncd projectname\n\n# open VS code editor\ncode .\n\n# open iOS Simulator - be patient, it may take a while\nopen -a Simulator.app\n\n# start running the app\nflutter run\n</code></pre>\n<p>And boom, you’re all set! 💅</p>\n<p>If you don’t wish to use the iOS simulator, you can always spin up your Android Studio emulator. Use <a href=\"https://www.genymotion.com/\">Genymotion</a> (or any other Android emulation software), or even connect a real device to your machine. This is a slower and more error-prone solution, so I recommend to only test on real devices when necessary.</p>\n<p>Once they have booted, you can run <code>flutter doctor</code> again and see if Flutter sees the connected device. You should get an output something just like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">...\n[✓] Connected device (1 available)\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you got this output - congratulations! 🎉 You’re all set to move on with this tutorial. If, for some reason Flutter didn’t recognize your device, please go back and check everything again as you won’t be able to follow the instructions from now on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"helloworld\">Hello world! 🌍</h2>\n<p>If you didn’t run the magic snippet previously, run these commands now:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\"># Create a new project\nflutter create &lt;projectname&gt;\n\n# move there\ncd projectname\n\n# open VS code editor (optional if you use Studio)\ncode .\n\n# start running the app\nflutter run\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will spin up the Flutter development server with <strong>stateful hot reload</strong> and a lot more for you. You’ll see, that by default, Flutter creates a project with a floating action button and a counter:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/10/flutter-demo-homepage_small2.png\" alt=\"Flutter Crash Course for JavaScript Developers\"></p>\n<p>Once you’re finished with playing around the counter, let’s dig into the code! 👨‍💻</p>\n<h2 id=\"flutterprojectstructure\">Flutter project structure</h2>\n<p>Before we dig right into the code, let’s take a look at the project structure of our Flutter app for a moment:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">├── README.md\n├── android\n│   └── ton of stuff going on here...\n├── build\n│   └── ton of stuff going on here...\n├── ios\n│   └── ton of stuff going on here...\n├── lib\n│   └── main.dart\n├── pubspec.lock\n├── pubspec.yaml\n└── test\n    └── widget_test.dart\n</code></pre>\n<p>We have a few platform-specific directories: <code>android</code> and <code>ios</code>. These contain the necessary stuff for building, like the <code>AndroidManifest</code>, <code>build.gradle</code>, or your <code>xcodeproj</code>.</p>\n<p>At this moment, we don’t need to modify the contents of these directories so we’ll ignore them for now. We’ll also ignore the <code>test</code> directory as we won’t cover testing Flutter in this series (but we may look into it later if there’s interest 👀), so that only leaves us to these:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">├── lib\n│   └── main.dart\n├── pubspec.lock\n├── pubspec.yaml\n</code></pre>\n<p>And this is where the magic happens. Inside the <code>lib</code> directory, you have the <code>main.dart</code>: that’s where all the code lives right now. We’ll peek into it later, but let’s just have a look at the <code>pubspec.yaml</code> and <code>pubspec.lock</code>.</p>\n<p>What are those?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/agmheddabICHK/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Flutter Crash Course for JavaScript Developers\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"packagemanagementinflutterpubdev\">Package management in Flutter - pub.dev</h3>\n<p>When building a project with JavaScript, we often use third party components, modules, packages, libraries, and frameworks so that we don’t have to reinvent the wheel. The JavaScript ecosystem has npm and yarn to provide you with all those spicy zeroes and ones, and they also handle the dependencies inside your project.</p>\n<p>In the Dart ecosystem, this is all handled by <a href=\"https://pub.dev\">pub.dev</a>.</p>\n<p>So, just a few quick facts:<br>\n<code>npm</code> 👉 <code>pub.dev</code><br>\n<code>package.json</code> 👉 <code>pubspec.yaml</code><br>\n<code>package-lock.json</code> 👉 <code>pubspec.lock</code></p>\n<p>We’ll look into installing packages and importing them into our app in the last episode of this series, in which we’ll create a fun mini-game.</p>\n<h2 id=\"diggingintothedartcode\">Digging into the Dart code</h2>\n<p>The only thing left from the file tree is <code>main.dart</code>. <code>main</code> is the heart of our app, it’s like the <code>index.js</code> of most JS-based projects. By default, when creating a project with <code>flutter create</code>, you’ll get a very well documented code with a <code>StatelessWidget</code>, a <code>StatefulWidget</code>, and its <code>State</code>.</p>\n<p>So instead of observing the demo code line by line together, I encourage you to read the generated code and comments by yourself and come back here later.</p>\n<p>In the next part, we’ll look into what are widgets and the <code>build</code> method.</p>\n<p>We’ll learn why it is <code>@override</code>d, and what’s the difference between stateful and stateless widgets. Then we’ll delete all the code from <code>main.dart</code> and create a Hello world app by ourselves so that you can get the hang of writing declarative UI code in Flutter.</p>\n<p><em>Go ahead, read the generated code and the documentation now! 👀</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"influttereverythingisawidget\">In Flutter, everything is a widget!</h3>\n<p>As you have been reading the code, you may have noticed a few things. The first thing after importing Flutter is the entry method I have been talking about in the previous episode:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">void main() {\n runApp(MyApp());\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then, you could see all those classes and OOP stuff come back with the line <code>class MyApp extends StatelessWidget</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>First things first: in Flutter, everything is a widget!</strong><br>\nOh, and speaking of widgets. Components 👉 Widgets!</p>\n<p>The <code>StatelessWidget</code> is a class from the Flutter framework, and it’s a type of widget. Another kind of widget is <code>StatefulWidget</code> and we’ll look into the difference between those and how to use them later.</p>\n<p>We can create our reusable widget by extending the base class <code>StatelessWidget</code> with our own <code>build</code> method. (By the way, <code>render</code> in ReactJS 👉 <code>build</code> in Flutter). We can see that the <code>build</code> returns a <code>Widget</code> because the return type is defined, and we can see an odd keyword in the previous line: <code>@override</code>.</p>\n<p>It’s needed because the <code>StatelessWidget</code> class has a definition for <code>build</code> by default, but we want to replace it (or override it) with our own implementation - hence the keyword <code>@override</code>. Before we dig further into the code, let’s have a peek at using widgets in Flutter:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// using a React component\n&lt;button onClick={() =&gt; console.log(‘clicked!’)}&gt;Hi, I’m a button&lt;/button&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">// using a Flutter widget\nRawMaterialButton(\n onPressed: () {\n   print(&quot;hi, i'm pressed&quot;);\n },\n child: Text(&quot;press me!&quot;),\n),\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can see that Flutter has a different approach with declarative UI code.</p>\n<p>Instead of wrapping children between <code>&gt;&lt;</code>s and passing props next to the component name (e.g. <code>&lt;button onClick ...</code>), everything is treated as a property. This enables Flutter to create more flexible and well-typed widgets: we’ll always know if a child is supposed to be a standalone widget or if it can accept multiple widgets as a property, for example. This will come in handy later when we’ll build layouts with <code>Row</code>s and <code>Column</code>s.</p>\n<p>Now that we know a bit more about widgets in Flutter, let’s take a look at the generated code again:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">@override\nWidget build(BuildContext context) {\n return MaterialApp(\n   title: 'Flutter Demo',\n   theme: ThemeData(\n     primarySwatch: Colors.blue,\n   ),\n   home: MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),\n );\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>build</code> method returns a <code>MaterialApp</code> that has a type of <code>Widget</code> and - unsurprisingly - comes from Flutter. This <a href=\"https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp-class.html\">MaterialApp</a> widget is a skeleton for your Flutter app. It contains all the routes, theme data, metadata, locales, and other app-level black magic you want to have set up. 🧙</p>\n<p>You can see the <code>MyHomePage</code> class being referenced as the <code>home</code> screen. It also has a <strong>property</strong>, <code>title</code>, set up. <code>MyHomePage</code> is also a widget, and we can confirm that by looking at the definition of this class.</p>\n<p><em>Quick tip: if you are using VSCode as your editor, hold Command and hover or click on the class reference and you’ll be directed to the code of the class.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/10/vscode-class-reference.png\" alt=\"Flutter Crash Course for JavaScript Developers\"></p>\n<p>We can see that <code>MyHomePage</code> extends a <code>StatefulWidget</code>. However, the structure of the code itself is a bit squiggly and weird. What’s this <code>MyHomePage({Key key, this.title}) : super(key: key);</code> syntax? Why doesn’t this widget have a <code>build</code> method? What’s a <code>State</code>? What is <code>createState</code>?</p>\n<p>To answer these questions, we’ll have to look into one of the more hard-code topics in Flutter: state management.</p>\n<h3 id=\"localstatemanagementinflutterstatefulwidgets\">Local state management in Flutter: StatefulWidgets</h3>\n<p>I previously talked about the two main types of widgets in Flutter: <code>StatelessWidget</code>s and <code>StatefulWidget</code>s. <code>StatelessWidget</code>s are pretty straightforward: a snippet of code that returns a Widget, maybe some properties are being passed around, but that’s all complexity.</p>\n<p>However, we don’t want to write applications that just display stuff! We want to add interactivity! And most interactions come with some state, whether it’s the data stored in an input field or some basic counter somewhere in your app. And once the state is updated, we want to re-render the affected widgets in our app - so that the new data is being displayed for the user.</p>\n<p>Think of state management in React: it has the very same purpose with the goal of being as efficient as possible. It’s no different in Flutter: we want to have some very simple widgets (or <code>StatelessWidgets</code>), and some widgets with a bit of complexity and interactivity (or <code>StatefulWidgets</code>).</p>\n<p>Let’s dive into the code: a StatefulWidget consists of two main components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a <code>StatefulWidget</code> (that is called <code>MyHomePage</code> in our case)</li>\n<li>a typed <code>State</code> object (that is called <code>_MyHomePageState</code> in this example)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We’ll call these “widget” and “state” (respectively) for the sake of simplicity. The widget itself contains all the props, and a <code>createState</code> overridden method. As you can see, the prop is marked with a <code>final</code> - that’s because you cannot change the prop from within the widget. When you modify a prop of a widget, Flutter throws the current instance away and creates a brand new <code>StatefulWidget</code>.</p>\n<p>Note that changing either the prop or the state will trigger a rebuild in Flutter - the key difference between the two is that changing the state can be initiated from within the widget while changing a prop is initiated by the parent widget.</p>\n<p><strong>Props help you pass data from parent to children. State helps you handle data change inside the children.</strong></p>\n<p>Now, let’s look into changing the state: inside the widget, we have a <code>createState</code> method that only returns the state, <code>_MyHomePageState()</code>. When modifying the state with the <code>setState</code> method, this <code>createState</code> method gets called and returns a new instance of your state. The old instance gets thrown away, and a new instance of your widget will be inserted into the widget tree.</p>\n<p><em>(Sidenote: the widget tree is only a blueprint of your app, the <strong>element tree</strong> is the one that gets rendered for the user. It’s a bit more advanced, under-the-hood topic, so it won’t be covered in this series - however, I’ll link some video resources later on that will help you understand how Flutter works and what’s the deal with the widget tree and the element tree.)</em></p>\n<p>The <code>_MyHomePageState</code> class has a type of <code>State</code>, typed with <code>MyHomePage</code>.</p>\n<p>This is needed so that you can access the properties set in the <code>MyHomePage</code> instance with the <code>widget</code> keyword - for example, to access the <code>title</code> prop, write <code>widget.title</code>. Inside the state, you have an overridden <code>build</code> method, just like you’d see in a typical <code>StatelessWidget</code>. This method returns a widget that renders some nice data, both from props (<code>widget.title</code>) and from the state (<code>_counter</code>).</p>\n<p>Notice that you don’t need to type in anything before the <code>_counter</code>. No <code>this.state._counter</code>, no <code>State.of(context)._counter</code>, just a plain old <code>_counter</code>. That’s because from the perspective of the code, this variable is declared just like any other would be:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">int _counter = 0;\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, when modifying this variable, we need to wrap our code in <code>setState</code>, like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">setState(() {\n _counter++;\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will tell Flutter that “Hey! It’s time to re-render me!”.</p>\n<p>The framework will call the previously discussed <code>createState</code> method; a new instance of your state gets created; built; rendered; and boom! 💥 The new data is now on-screen.</p>\n<p>It may seem a bit complicated or seem like you have to write a lot of boilerplate code to get this running. But don’t worry! With VS Code, you can refactor any <code>StatelessWidget</code> into a stateful one with just one click:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/10/vscode-convert-flutter-stateless-widget-to-stateful-widget.png\" alt=\"Flutter Crash Course for JavaScript Developers\"></p>\n<p>And that’s it for managing your widget’s state! It may be a lot at first, but you’ll get used to it after building a few widgets.</p>\n<h3 id=\"afewnotesaboutglobalstatemanagementinflutter\">A few notes about global state management in Flutter</h3>\n<p>Right now, we only looked at working with local state in Flutter - handling app-level, or global state is a bit more complex. There are, just like in JS, tons of solutions, ranging from the built-in <code>InheritedWidget</code> to a number of third-party state management libraries. Some of those may already be familiar, for example, there is <a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/rxdart\">RxDart</a> and <a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/redux\">Redux</a>, just to name a few. To learn more about the most popular solutions, and which one to choose for your project, I suggest you watch this awesome video about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tm-R7ymwhc\">global state management in Flutter</a> by Fireship.</p>\n<h2 id=\"widgetswidgetsandwidgets\">Widgets, widgets, and widgets</h2>\n<p>I already talked about how <strong>everything</strong> is a widget in Flutter - however, I didn’t really introduce you to some of the most useful and popular widgets in Flutter, so let’s have a look at them before we move on!</p>\n<p>Flutter has widgets for displaying texts, buttons, native controls like switches and sliders (<code>cupertino</code> for iOS and <code>material</code> for Android style widgets), layout widgets like <code>Stack</code>, <code>Row</code>, <code>Column</code> and more. There are literally hundreds of widgets that are available for you out of the box, and the list keeps growing.</p>\n<p>The whole widget library can be found <a href=\"https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets\">here in the Widget Catalog</a>, and the Flutter team is also working on a very nice video series with new episodes being released weekly. This series is called Flutter Widget of the Week, and they introduce you to a Flutter widget, it’s use cases, show you code examples and more, in just about one minute! It’s really binge-worthy if you want to get to know some useful Flutter widgets, tips, and tricks.</p>\n<p>Here a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjxrf2q8roU23XGwz3Km7sQZFTdB996iG\">link for the whole series playlist</a>, and here is the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_sQ9bMltGU\">intro episode</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"someusefulwidgetsinflutter\">Some useful widgets in Flutter</h3>\n<p>As you’ll work with Flutter, you’ll explore more and more widgets, but there are some basic Flutter widgets you’ll absolutely need to build your first application. (We’ll probably use most of them in the next and last episode of this series, so stay tuned!)</p>\n<p>First and foremost: <code>Text</code>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Text-class.html\">Text widget</a> delivers what its name promises: you can display strings with it. You can also style or format your text and even make multiline texts. (There’s are a lot of line of text-related widgets available, covering your needs from displaying <a href=\"https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/RichText-class.html\">rich text fields</a> to creating <a href=\"https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/SelectableText-class.html\">selectable texts</a>.)</p>\n<p>An example Text widget in Flutter:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">Text('hello world!'),\n</code></pre>\n<p>Adding buttons to your Flutter app is also easy as one two three. There are numerous button-related widgets available for you ranging from<br>\n<a href=\"https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/RawMaterialButton-class.html\">RawMaterialButton</a> to  <a href=\"https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/FlatButton-class.html\">FlatButton</a>, <a href=\"https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/IconButton-class.html\">IconButton</a>, and <a href=\"https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/RaisedButton-class.html\">RaisedButton</a>, and there are also specific widgets for creating <a href=\"https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/FloatingActionButton-class.html\">FloatingActionButton</a>s and <a href=\"https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/OutlineButton-class.html\">OutlineButton</a>s. I randomly picked 🎲 the <code>RaisedButton</code> for us so that we can have a peek at how easy it is to add a nice, stylish button into our app:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">RaisedButton(\n onPressed: () {\n   print(\n     &quot;hi! it's me, the button, speaking via the console. over.&quot;,\n   );\n },\n child: Text(&quot;press meeeeeee&quot;),\n),\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"buildinglayoutsinflutter\">Building layouts in Flutter</h2>\n<p>When building flexible and complex layouts on the web and in React-Native, the most important tool you used was flexbox. While Flutter isn’t a web-based UI library and hence lacks flexbox, the main concept of using flexible containers with directions and whatnot is implemented and preferred in Flutter. It can be achieved by using <code>Row</code>s and <code>Column</code>s, and you can stack widgets on each other by using <code>Stack</code>s.</p>\n<p>Consider the following cheatsheet I made:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/10/layouts-in-flutter-guide.png\" alt=\"Flutter Crash Course for JavaScript Developers\"></p>\n<p>Remember how I previously praised typing the props of a widget and how it’s one of the best tools in Flutter’s declarative UI pattern? The <code>Row</code>, <code>Column</code> and <code>Stack</code> widgets all have a <code>children</code> property that want an <strong>array</strong> of widgets, or <code>[Widget]</code>. Lucky for you, the VS Code automatically completes the code for you once you start working with these widgets:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/10/vscode-layout-autocomplete.png\" alt=\"Flutter Crash Course for JavaScript Developers\"></p>\n<p><em>Just hit tab to let Code complete the code for you! Maybe in the future, you won’t need to write code at all, Flutter will just suck out the app idea out of your brain and compile that - but until then, get used to hitting tab.</em></p>\n<p>Let’s look at an example where we display some names underneath each other:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">Column(\n children: &lt;Widget&gt;[\n   Text(&quot;Mark&quot;),\n   Text(&quot;Imola&quot;),\n   Text(&quot;Martin&quot;),\n   Text(&quot;Zoe&quot;),\n ],\n),\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can see that you create a <strong>typed list</strong> with the <code>&lt;Widget&gt;[]</code> syntax, you pass it as a prop for the Column, create some amazing widgets inside the list, and boom! The children will be displayed underneath each other. Don’t believe me? Believe this amazing screenshot. 📸</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/10/names-screenshot.png\" alt=\"Flutter Crash Course for JavaScript Developers\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"alignment\">Alignment</h3>\n<p>The real power of <code>Column</code>s and <code>Row</code>s isn’t just placing stuff next to each other, just like flexbox isn’t only about <code>flex-direction</code> either. In Flutter, you can align the children of a <code>Column</code> and <code>Row</code> on two axes, <code>mainAxis</code> and <code>crossAxis</code>.</p>\n<p>These two properties are contextual: whilst in a <code>Row</code>, the main axis would be horizontal, and the crossing axis would be vertical, it would be switched in a <code>Column</code>. To help you better understand this axis concept, I created a handy cheat sheet with code examples and more.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/10/layout-alignments-in-flutter.png\" alt=\"Flutter Crash Course for JavaScript Developers\"></p>\n<p>So, for example, if you want to perfectly center something, you’d want to use either the <code>Center</code> widget; or a <code>Row</code> or <code>Column</code> with both <code>mainAxisAlignment</code> and <code>crossAxisAlignment</code> set to <code>.center</code>; or a <code>Row</code> and <code>Column</code> with their <code>mainAxisAlignment</code>s set to <code>.center</code>. The possibilities are basically endless with these widgets! ✨</p>\n<h2 id=\"renderinglistsflatlistslistviews\">Rendering lists (FlatLists 👉 ListViews)</h2>\n<p>Whilst thinking about possible use cases for columns, you may have wondered about creating scrollable, dynamic, reorderable, or endless lists.</p>\n<p>While these features could be achieved by using <code>Column</code>s, it would take a lot of effort to do so, not even mentioning updating your list data or lazy rendering widgets when there’s a crapton of data. Lucky you, Flutter has a class for rendering lists of data, and it’s called a <code>ListView</code>!</p>\n<p>There are several ways to use a <code>ListView</code>, but the most important ones are the <code>ListView(...)</code> widget and the <code>ListView.builder</code> method. Both of them achieve the very same functionality from the perspective of the user, but programmatically, they differ big time.</p>\n<p>First, let’s look into the <code>ListView(..)</code> widget. Syntactically, they are very similar to a <code>Column</code> except that they lack the main and cross-axis alignment properties. To continue on with our previous example for columns when we placed names under each other, I’ll display the very same column converted into a ListView:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">ListView(\n children: &lt;Widget&gt;[\n   Text(&quot;Mark&quot;),\n   Text(&quot;Imola&quot;),\n   Text(&quot;Martin&quot;),\n   Text(&quot;Zoe&quot;),\n ],\n),\n</code></pre>\n<p>Tada! 🎉 Your first ListView in Flutter! When refreshing or rebuilding the app (by either pressing a small or capital R in the Flutter CLI), you’ll see the very same thing you saw previously.</p>\n<p>However, if you try to drag it, you are now able to scroll inside the container! <strong>Note that when a <code>Column</code> has bigger children than its bounds, it will overflow, but a <code>ListView</code> will be scrollable.</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"listviewbuilder\">ListView builder</h3>\n<p>While the ListView widget is <em>cool and good</em>, it may not be suitable for every use case. For example, when displaying a list of tasks in a todo app, you won’t exactly know the number of items in your list while writing the code, and it may even change over time. Sure, you are able to run <code>.map</code> on the data source, return widgets as results, and then spread it with the <code>...</code> operator, but that obviously wouldn’t be performant, nor is it a good practice for long lists. Instead, Flutter provides us a really nice ListView builder.</p>\n<p><em>Sidenote: while working with Flutter, you’ll see the word “builder” a lot. For example, in places like FutureBuilder, StreamBuilder, AnimatedBuilder, the build method, the ListView builder, and more. It’s just a fancy word for methods that return a <code>Widget</code> or <code>[Widget]</code>, don’t let this word intimidate or confuse you!</em></p>\n<p>So how do we work with this awesome method? First, you should have an array or list that the builder can iterate over. I’ll quickly define an array with some names in it:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">final List&lt;String&gt; source = [&quot;Sarah&quot;, &quot;Mac&quot;, &quot;Jane&quot;, &quot;Daniel&quot;];\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then, somewhere in your widget tree, you should be able to call the <code>ListView.builder</code> method, provide some properties, and you’ll be good to go:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">ListView.builder(\n itemCount: source.length,\n itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int i) =&gt; Text(source[i]),\n),\n</code></pre>\n<p>Oh, and notice how I was able to use an arrow function, just like in JavaScript!</p>\n<p>The <code>itemCount</code> parameter is not required, but it’s recommended. Flutter will be able to optimize your app better if you provide this parameter. You can also limit the maximum number of rendered items by providing a number smaller than the length of your data source.</p>\n<p>When in doubt, you can always have a peek at the documentation of a class, method, or widget by hovering over its name in your editor:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/10/vscode-docs.png\" alt=\"Flutter Crash Course for JavaScript Developers\"></p>\n<p>And that sums up the layout and list-related part of this episode. We’ll look into providing “stylesheets” (or theme data) for your app, look at some basic routing (or navigation) methods, and fetch some data from the interwebs with HTTP requests.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theminginflutter\">Theming in Flutter</h2>\n<p>While building larger applications with custom UI components, you may want to create stylesheets. In Flutter, they are called Themes, and they can be used in a lot of places. For example, you can set a default app color, and then the selected texts, buttons, ripple animations, and more will follow this color. You can also set up text styles (like headings and more), and you’ll be able to access these styles across the app.</p>\n<p>To do so, you should provide a <code>theme</code> property for your <code>MaterialApp</code> at the root level of the application. Here’s an example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">return MaterialApp(\n     title: 'RisingStack Flutter Demo',\n     theme: ThemeData(\n       // Define the default brightness and colors.\n       brightness: Brightness.light,\n       primaryColor: Colors.green[300],\n       accentColor: Colors.green,\n \n       // Define button theme\n       buttonTheme: ButtonThemeData(\n         buttonColor: Colors.green,\n         shape: CircleBorder(),\n       ),\n \n         // Define the default font family\n        // (this won’t work as we won’t have this font asset yet)\n       fontFamily: 'Montserrat',\n \n       // Define the default TextTheme. Use this to specify the default\n       // text styling for headlines, titles, bodies of text, and more.\n       textTheme: TextTheme(\n         headline1: TextStyle(fontSize: 72.0, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),\n         headline6: TextStyle(fontSize: 36.0, fontStyle: FontStyle.italic),\n         bodyText2: TextStyle(fontSize: 14.0, fontFamily: 'Muli'),\n       ),\n     ),\n     home: Scaffold(...),\n   );\n</code></pre>\n<p>These colors will be used throughout our app, and accessing the text themes is also simple as a pickle! I added a <code>RaisedButton</code> on top of the app so that we can see the new <code>ButtonThemeData</code> being applied to it:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/10/themed-button-flutter.png\" alt=\"Flutter Crash Course for JavaScript Developers\"></p>\n<p>It’s ugly and all, but it’s ours! 🍋 Applying the text style won’t be automatic, though. As we previously discussed, Flutter can’t really read your mind, so you explicitly need to tag Text widgets as a <code>headline1</code> or <code>bodyText2</code>, for example.</p>\n<p>To do so, you’ll use the <code>Theme.of(context)</code> method. This will look up the widget tree for the nearest <code>Theme</code> providing widget (and note that you can create custom or local themes for subparts of your app with the <code>Theme</code> widget!) and return that theme. Let’s look at an example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">Text(\n &quot;cool names&quot;,\n style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline6,\n),\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can see that we are accessing the theme with the <code>Theme.of(context)</code> method, and then we are just accessing properties like it’s an object. This is all you need to know about theming a Flutter app as it really isn’t a complex topic!</p>\n<h2 id=\"designingmobilenavigationexperiences\">Designing mobile navigation experiences</h2>\n<p>On the web, when managing different screens of the app, we used paths (e.g. <code>fancysite.com/registration</code>) and routing (e.g., <code>react-router</code>) to handle navigating back and forth the app. In a mobile app, it works a bit differently, so I’ll first introduce you to navigation on mobile, and then we’ll look into implementing it in Flutter.</p>\n<p>Mobile navigation differs from the web in a lot of ways. Gestures and animations play a very heavy role in structuring out the hierarchy of the app for your user. For example, when a user navigates to a new screen, and it slides in from the right side of the screen, the user will expect to be able to move back with a slide from the left. Users also don’t expect flashy loadings and empty screens when navigating - and even though there are advancements on the web in this segment (e.g. PWAs), it’s by far not the default experience when using websites.</p>\n<p>There are also different hierarchies when designing mobile apps. The three main groups are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Hierarchical Navigation</strong> <em>(e.g. the Settings app on iOS)</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>New screens slide in from left to right. The expected behavior for navigating back is with a back button on the upper left corner and by swiping from the left edge of the screen to the right.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Flat Navigation</strong> <em>(e.g. the Apple Music app)</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The default behavior for this hierarchy is a tab bar on the bottom.</li>\n<li>Tabs should always preserve location (e.g. if you navigate to a subscreen inside on tab one, switch to tab two and switch back to tab one, you’d expect to be on the subscreen, not on the root level screen.)</li>\n<li>Swiping between tabs is optional. It isn’t the default behavior and it may conflict with other gestures on the screen itself - be cautious and think twice before implementing swipeable tab bars.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Custom, content-driven, or experimental navigation</strong> <em>(Games, books and other content)</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>When making experimental navigation, always try to be sane with the navigation. The user should always be able to navigate back and undo stuff.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I created a handy cheat sheet for you that will remind you of the most important things when in doubt:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/10/mobile-navigation-ux-guide-for-flutter-developers.png\" alt=\"Flutter Crash Course for JavaScript Developers\"></p>\n<p>Also, all of these can be mixed together, and other screens like modals can be added to the stack. Always try to KISS and make sure that the user can always navigate back and undo things. Don’t try to reinvent the wheel with navigation (e.g., reverse the direction of opening up a new screen) as it will just confuse the user.</p>\n<p>Also, always indicate where the user is in the hierarchy (e.g., with labeling buttons, app title bar, coloring the bottom bar icons, showing little dots, etc.). If you want to know more about designing mobile navigation experiences and implementing them in a way that feels natural to the user, check out Apple’s <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/app-architecture/navigation/\">Human Interface Guideline’s related articles</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/3OvvA11fPUvfYRFjxS/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Flutter Crash Course for JavaScript Developers\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"navigationinflutter\">Navigation in Flutter</h2>\n<p>When routing on the web with React or React-Native, you had to depend on third-party libraries to get the dirty work done for you (e.g. <code>react-router</code>). Luckily, Flutter has native navigation capabilities out of the box, and they cover every need of most of the apps, and they are provided to you via the <a href=\"https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Navigator-class.html\">Navigator API</a>.</p>\n<p>The applications of this API and the possibilities to play around with navigation are endless. You can, for example, animate a widget between screens; build a bottom navigation bar or a hamburger menu; pass arguments; or send data back and forth. You can explore every navigation-related Flutter cookbook <a href=\"https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/navigation\">here</a>. In this series, we’ll only look into initializing two screens, navigating between them, and sharing some widgets between them.</p>\n<p>To get started with navigation, let’s create two widgets that we’ll use as screens and pass the first into a <code>MaterialApp</code> as the <code>home</code> property:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">import 'package:flutter/material.dart';\n \nvoid main() {\n runApp(MyApp());\n}\n \nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n @override\n Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n   return MaterialApp(\n     title: 'Flutter Demo',\n     home: ScreenOne(),\n   );\n }\n}\n \nclass ScreenOne extends StatelessWidget {\n @override\n Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n   return Scaffold(\n     body: Center(\n       child: Text(&quot;hey! 👋&quot;),\n     ),\n   );\n }\n}\n \nclass ScreenTwo extends StatelessWidget {\n @override\n Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n   return Scaffold(\n     body: Center(\n       child: Text(&quot;hi! 👋👋&quot;),\n     ),\n   );\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This was easy as a breeze. If you run this app in a simulator, you’ll see “hey! 👋” on the center of the screen. Now, inside the <code>MaterialApp</code>, we can define our <code>routes</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">return MaterialApp(\n title: 'Flutter Demo',\n home: ScreenOne(),\n routes: &lt;String, WidgetBuilder&gt;{\n   '/hey': (BuildContext context) =&gt; ScreenOne(),\n   '/hi': (BuildContext context) =&gt; ScreenTwo(),\n },\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, we’ll need something that will trigger the navigation. I’ll add a <code>RaisedButton</code> to the <code>ScreenOne</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">return Scaffold(\n body: Column(\n   mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,\n   crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,\n   children: &lt;Widget&gt;[\n     Text(&quot;hey! 👋&quot;),\n     RaisedButton(\n       child: Text(&quot;take me there&quot;),\n       onPressed: () {\n         print(&quot;hi!&quot;);\n       },\n     ),\n   ],\n ),\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>And now, we can navigate the user to the next screen when the button is pressed. Notice that I replaced the <code>Center</code> with a <code>Column</code> with both its main and cross axises centered. This was required because I wanted to have two children underneath each other: a <code>Text</code> and a <code>RaisedButton</code>. Inside the <code>RaisedButton</code>, we only have to push the route to the stack and let Flutter handle the routing and animation:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/hi');\n</code></pre>\n<p>By default, we can navigate back to the previous screen by swiping from the left edge of the screen. This is the expected behavior, and we don’t intend to change it, so we’ll leave it as it is. If you want to add a button on the second screen to navigate back to the first screen, you can use <code>Navigator.pop();</code> method.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t ever <code>push</code> to the same screen the user is on, nor the previous screen. Always use <code>pop</code> when navigating backward.</strong></p>\n<p>This will be just enough to cover your basic navigation needs. Don’t forget, if you want to check out more advanced navigation features such as animating widgets between screens or passing data back and forth, check out the related <a href=\"https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/navigation\">Flutter cookbooks</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"networkinghttprequests\">Networking, HTTP requests</h2>\n<p>Now that you can build widgets, layouts, display lists, and you can navigate between screens with Flutter, there’s only one thing left: communicating with your backend API. One of the most popular BaaS providers for mobile and Flutter is <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/\">Firebase by Google</a>. It allows you to use real-time databases, push notifications, crash reporting, app analytics, and a lot more out of the box. You can find the Flutter Firebase packages on pub.dev or you can <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup\">follow this step-by-step tutorial</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are a more experienced developer and you have a complex project with a custom backend in mind, or if you are just genuinely looking forward to using your own selection of backend APIs - Firebase just won’t suit your needs.</p>\n<p>That’s where the <a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/http\">http package</a> comes in handy.</p>\n<p>Just add it into your dependency list inside the <code>pubspec.yaml</code>, wait until <code>flutter pub get</code> finishes (VSCode automatically runs it for you if it detects changes in the <code>pubspec.yaml</code>), and then continue reading:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">dependencies:\n flutter:\n   sdk: flutter\n  http: any\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>http</code> is a Future-based library for making HTTP requests. To get started with it, just import it:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then, you can start making requests with top-level methods like <code>http.post</code> or <code>http.get</code>. To help you experiment with making HTTP requests in Flutter, I have made a demo API that you can <code>GET</code> on. It will return some names and ages. You can access it <a href=\"https://demo-flutter-api.herokuapp.com/people\">here</a> (<code>https://demo-flutter-api.herokuapp.com/people</code>).</p>\n<h3 id=\"parsingjsondatainflutteranddart\">Parsing JSON data in Flutter and Dart</h3>\n<p>After making your <code>GET</code> request on the API, you’ll be able to get data out of it by accessing properties like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">void request() async {\n final response =\n     await http.get(&quot;https://demo-flutter-api.herokuapp.com/people&quot;);\n print(response.body); // =&gt; [{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Leo&quot;,&quot;age&quot;:17},{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Isabella&quot;,&quot;age&quot;:30},{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Michael&quot;,&quot;age&quot;:23},{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Sarah&quot;,&quot;age&quot;:12}]\n print(json.decode(response.body)[0][&quot;name&quot;]); // =&gt; Leo\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>However, this solution should not be used in production.</strong> Not only it lacks automatic code completion and developer tooling, but it’s very error-prone and not really well documented. It’s just straight-up crap coding. 💩</p>\n<p>Instead, you should <strong>always</strong> create a Dart class with the desired data structure for your response object and then process the raw body into a native Dart object. Since we are receiving an array of objects, in Dart, we’ll create a typed <code>List</code> with a custom class. I’ll name the class <code>Person</code>, and it will have two properties: a <code>name</code> (with a type of <code>String</code>) and <code>age</code> (<code>int</code>). I’ll also want to define a <code>.fromJson</code> constructor on it so that we can set up our class to be able to construct itself from a raw JSON string.</p>\n<p>First, you’ll want to import <code>dart:convert</code> to access native JSON-related methods like a JSON encoder and decoder:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">import 'dart:convert';\n</code></pre>\n<p>Create our very basic class:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">class Person {\n String name;\n int age;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Extend it with a simple constructor:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">Person({this.name, this.age});\n</code></pre>\n<p>And add in the <code>.fromJson</code> method, tagged with the <code>factory</code> keyword. This keyword informs the compiler that this isn’t a method on the class instance itself. Instead, it will return a new instance of our class:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">factory Person.fromJson(String str) =&gt; Person.fromMap(json.decode(str));\nfactory Person.fromMap(Map&lt;String, dynamic&gt; json) =&gt; new Person(\n     name: json[&quot;name&quot;],\n     age: json[&quot;age&quot;],\n   );\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that I created two separate methods: a <code>fromMap</code> and a <code>fromJson</code>. The <code>fromMap</code> method itself does the dirty work by deconstructing the received <code>Map</code>. The <code>fromJson</code> just parses our JSON string and passes it into the <code>fromMap</code> factory method.</p>\n<p>Now, we should just map over our raw response, use the <code>.fromMap</code> factory method, and expect everything to go just fine:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">List&lt;Person&gt; listOfPeople = json\n   .decode(response.body)\n   .map&lt;Person&gt;((i) =&gt; Person.fromMap(i))\n   .toList();\n \nprint(listOfPeople[0].name); // =&gt; Leo\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Sidenote: I didn’t use the <code>.fromJson</code> method because we already parsed the body before mapping over it, hence it’s unneeded right now.</em></p>\n<p>There is a lot to unwrap in these few lines! First, we define a typed list and decode the <code>response.body</code>. Then, we map over it, and we throw in the return type <code>&lt;Person&gt;</code> to the <code>map</code> so that Dart will know that we expect to see a <code>Person</code> as a result of the map function. Then, we convert it to a <code>List</code> as otherwise it would be an <code>MappedListIterable</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"renderingtheparsedjsonfuturebuilderandlistviewbuilder\">Rendering the parsed JSON: FutureBuilder and ListView.builder</h3>\n<p>Now that we have our app up and running with our basic backend, it’s time to render our data. We already discussed the <code>ListView.builder</code> API, so we’ll just work with that.</p>\n<p>But before we get into rendering the list itself, we want to handle some state changes: the response may be undefined at the moment of rendering (because it is still loading), and we may get an error as a response. There are several great approaches to wrap your head around handling these states, but we’ll use <code>FutureBuilder</code> now for the sake of practicing using new Flutter widgets.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FutureBuilder-class.html\"><code>FutureBuilder</code></a> is a Flutter widget that takes a Future and a builder as a property. This builder will return the widget we want to render on the different states as the <code>Future</code> progresses.</p>\n<p><strong>Note that <code>FutureBuilder</code> handles state changes inside the widget itself, so you can still use it in a <code>StatelessWidget</code>!</strong> Since the <code>http</code> package is Future-based, we can just use the <code>http.get</code> method as the Future for our <code>FutureBuilder</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">@override\nWidget build(BuildContext context) {\n return Scaffold(\n   body: FutureBuilder(\n     future: http.get(&quot;https://demo-flutter-api.herokuapp.com/people&quot;),\n   ),\n );\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And we should also pass a <code>builder</code>. This builder should be able to respond to three states: <code>loading</code>, <code>done</code> and <code>error</code>. At first, I’ll just throw in a centered <code>CircularProgressIndicator()</code> to see that our app renders something:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">return Scaffold(\n body: FutureBuilder(\n   future: http.get(&quot;https://demo-flutter-api.herokuapp.com/people&quot;),\n   builder: (BuildContext context, AsyncSnapshot&lt;http.Response&gt; response) {\n     return Center(\n       child: CircularProgressIndicator(),\n     );\n   },\n ),\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you run this app, you’ll see a progress indicator in the center of the screen running indefinitely. We can get the state of the <code>response</code> by the <code>response.hasData</code> property:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">builder: (BuildContext context, AsyncSnapshot&lt;http.Response&gt; response) {\n if (response.hasData) {\n   // loaded!\n } else if (response.hasError) {\n   // error!\n   return Center(\n     child: Text(&quot;error!&quot;),\n   );\n } else {\n   // loading...\n   return Center(\n     child: CircularProgressIndicator(),\n   );\n }\n},\n</code></pre>\n<p>And now, we can be sure that nothing comes between us and processing, then rendering the data, so inside the <code>response.hasData</code> block, we’ll process the raw response with previously discussed parsing and mapping method, then return a <code>ListView.builder</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">// loaded!\nList&lt;Person&gt; listOfPeople = json\n   .decode(response.data.body)\n   .map&lt;Person&gt;((i) =&gt; Person.fromMap(i))\n   .toList();\n \nreturn ListView.builder(\n itemCount: listOfPeople.length,\n itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int i) =&gt; Text(\n   &quot;${listOfPeople[i].name} (${listOfPeople[i].age})&quot;,\n ),\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>And that’s it! 🎉 If you run this snippet right now, it will render four names and their corresponding ages next to them. Isn’t this amazing? It may have seemed like a lot of work for a simple list like this, but don’t forget that we created a whole-blown class, parsed JSON, and converted it into class instances, and we even handled loading and error states.</p>\n<h2 id=\"summingitallup\">Summing it all up</h2>\n<p>Congratulations on making it this far into the course!

Let’s get started!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let's learn the Dart language as JS developers: We dive into OOP, classes, inheritance, and mixins, asynchrony, callbacks, async/await and streams.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Also, you can take a look at the next part of this series as well: <a href=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/flutter-crash-course-javascript/\">Flutter Crash Course for JavaScript Developers</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"whywouldyouwanttolearnflutteranddart\">Why would you want to learn Flutter and Dart?</h2>\n<p>Flutter and Dart are made by Google. While Dart is a programming language, Flutter is a UI toolkit that can compile to <strong>native Android and iOS</strong> code, has experimental <strong>web and desktop app support</strong>, and it’s the native framework for building apps for <strong>Google’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Fuchsia\">Fuchsia OS</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>This means that you don’t need to worry about the platform, and you can focus on the product itself. The compiled app is always native code as Dart compiles to ARM, hence providing you the best cross-platform performance you can get right now with <strong>over 60 fps</strong>. Flutter also helps the fast development cycle with <strong>stateful hot reload</strong>, which we’ll make use of mostly in the last episode of this series.</p>\n<p>By the end of this series, you’ll have a basic understanding of Dart, the basic data structures, object-oriented programming, and asynchrony with futures and streams.</p>\n<p>In Flutter, you’ll take a look at widgets, theming, navigation, networking, routing, using third-party packages, native APIs, and a lot more. Then, in the last episode of this series, we’ll put it all together and build a full-blown minigame together! Seems exciting? Then keep reading!</p>\n<p>This episode of the series focuses on the Dart part of this ecosystem. <a href=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/flutter-crash-course-javascript/\">We’ll look into Flutter in the next episode</a>, and then we’ll put it all together into a fun minigame in the last episode. I’m excited to see what you’ll all build with Flutter, so let’s jump right in!</p>\n<p><em>Sidenote: throughout this series, I'll use the “👉” emoji to compare JS and Dart language examples. Typically, the left side will be the JS, and the right side will be the Dart equivalent, e.g. <code>console.log(&quot;hi!&quot;);</code> 👉 <code>print(&quot;hello!&quot;);</code></em></p>\n<h2 id=\"dartvsjavascripttheprosandcons\">Dart vs JavaScript - the pros and cons</h2>\n<p>JavaScript and Dart cannot be directly compared as they both have different use cases and target audiences. However, they both have their own advantages and disadvantages, and after a few projects with both technologies, you’ll get to see where they perform well.</p>\n<p>There are some things, however, that you’ll notice as you are getting into the Flutter ecosystem: <strong>Dart has a steeper learning curve</strong> with all those types, abstract concepts and OOP - but don’t let that throw you off your track.</p>\n<p><strong>JavaScript has a bigger community,</strong> and hence more questions on StackOverflow, more packages, resources, learning materials, and meetups.</p>\n<p>But once you get the hang of Dart, you’ll notice that <strong>Dart and Flutter has much-much better developer tooling, it’s faster,</strong> and compared to <a href=\"https://pub.dev\">pub.dev</a>, <em>(Dart’s package repository)</em> npm has more packages with worse quality.</p>\n<h2 id=\"variablesandtypesinthedartlanguage\">Variables and types in the Dart language</h2>\n<p>After the first glance at a Dart code snippet, you may notice a concept that you may be unfamiliar with if you only know JS. <strong>Dart is type safe</strong>.</p>\n<p>It means that when you want to define a variable, you’ll either have to provide an initial value and let the compiler figure out what type matches it (implicit typing), or (and this is the optimal case) you’ll have to provide the type of the variable explicitly.</p>\n<p>In programming, types define what kind of data you are trying to store in your variable - for example, with an <code>int</code> type, you’ll be able to store an integer number (e.g. 7). In Dart, the most commonly used primitive types are <code>int</code>, <code>double</code>,  <code>string</code> and <code>boolean</code>. Here are some language examples:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">// Heads up! This is some nasty Dart code!\nvar num = 0; // Dart will implicitly give this variable an int type. var, let 👉var\nint myInt = 3; // this is an explicitly typed variable\nfinal double pi = 3.14; // const 👉final, static and const, more info below\n\nmyInt = 3.2; // will throw an error as 3.2 is not an integer\npi = 3.2; // will throw an error as pi is marked with final\n\nString name = &quot;Mark&quot;;\n</code></pre>\n<p>There’s also a “fallback-type” or a non-typed type: <code>dynamic</code>. In Dart, the <code>dynamic</code> type can be used whenever the exact type of a parameter, argument, list item, or anything else cannot be determined while writing your code. Please always be extra careful when working with dynamically typed variables and add extra safety barriers to your code so that your app doesn’t crash when an unexpected type gets passed. Try to avoid using <code>dynamic</code> as much as possible.</p>\n<p><em>Oh, and a quick tip: to play around with Dart, you can use <a href=\"https://dartpad.dev/\">DartPad</a>. It’s an online Dart compiler, or a “playground” made by the Dart team.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"afewwordsaboutfinalstaticandconst\">A few words about final, static and const</h3>\n<p>In Dart, we can create constants with three keywords: <code>final</code>, <code>static</code>, and <code>const</code>. <code>final</code> can be only created once in the runtime, while <code>const</code> is created at compile-time. You can think of <code>const</code> as an even stricter <code>final</code>. (When in doubt, you can use <code>final</code> and you’ll be just fine. To read more about the keywords <code>final</code>, <code>static</code>, and <code>const</code>, check out <a href=\"https://news.dartlang.org/2012/06/const-static-final-oh-my.html\">this article</a> on the official Dart blog.</p>\n<p>To get to know more about variables and the built-in types in Dart, please refer to this <a href=\"https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour#built-in-types\">short explanation</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"writingyourfirstdartlanguagefunction\">Writing your first Dart language function</h2>\n<p>Type-safety will come up in a lot of places - for example, when writing functions, you’ll have to define the return type and the type of the arguments.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">// return type, function name, parameters with their types and names\ndouble addDoubles(double a, double b) {\n    return a + b;\n}\n\naddDoubles(3.2, 1.4); // =&gt; will return 4.6\n</code></pre>\n<p>And when your function doesn’t return anything, you can throw in the keyword <code>void</code> - just like the entry point of every Dart program, <code>void main()</code> does.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">void main() {\n    print(addNumbers(2, 3));  // console.log() 👉print()\n\n    // this function does not return anything!\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><em><strong>What’s an entry point anyways?</strong> In JavaScript, the code starts executing from the first line and goes linearly line-by-line until it reaches the end of the file. In Dart, you have to have a <code>main()</code> function that will serve as the body of your program. The compiler will start the execution with the <code>main</code> function, that’s where it enters your code - hence the name entry point.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"controlflowstatementsifforwhileetc\">Control flow statements - if, for, while, etc.</h2>\n<p>They look and work just like in JavaScript. Here are some examples:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">int age = 20;\n\nif(age &gt;= 18) {\n    print(&quot;here’s some beer! 🍻&quot;);\n} else {\n    print(&quot;🙅‍♂️sorry, no alcohol for you...&quot;);\n}\n\n// let’s count from 1 to 10!\n// p.s.: notice the `int i`\nfor (int i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i++) {\n    print(&quot;it’s number $i&quot;);   // string interpolation: ${} 👉 $ (for variable names)\n}\n\n// while loops:\n// please don’t run this snippet, it will probably crash or run out of resources...\nwhile(&quot;🍌&quot; == &quot;🍌&quot;) {  // oh, and forget ===, you don’t need it in Dart!\n    print(&quot;Hey! 👋 I’m a banana!&quot;);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"arraysandobjects\">Arrays and objects</h2>\n<p>In JavaScript, to store multiple pieces of data together, we use arrays and objects. In Dart, we call them lists and maps, and they work a bit differently under the hood (and they have some extra APIs!). Let’s look into them!</p>\n<h3 id=\"arraylist\">Array 👉List</h3>\n<p>In Dart, a list ideally stores an <strong>array of homogenous data</strong> . That’s right -- no more <code>[1, &quot;banana&quot;, null, 3.44]</code> (ideally)! You can create a list with the <code>[]</code> syntax you are already familiar with from JS, and with the <code>new List()</code> constructor.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">// the usual, implicitly typed, [] syntax\nvar continents = [&quot;Europe&quot;, &quot;North America&quot;, &quot;South America&quot;, &quot;Africa&quot;, &quot;Asia&quot;, &quot;Australia&quot;]; \ncontinents.add(&quot;Antarctica&quot;);  // .push() 👉 .add()\n\n// please note that when throwing in multiple types of data, Dart will fall back to the `dynamic` type for your list:\nvar maybeBanana = [1, &quot;banana&quot;, null, 3.44];\n\n// the `new List()` syntax, with a dynamic length:\n// note the List&lt;T&gt; syntax: you need to pass in the desired value type between the &lt;&gt;s\nList&lt;int&gt; someNiceNumbers = new List();\nsomeNiceNumbers.add(5);\n\n// fixed-length list:\nList&lt;int&gt; threeNiceNumbers = new List(3); // this list will be able to hold 3 items, at max.\n\n// dynamic list with the new List() syntax:\nList&lt;dynamic&gt; stuff = new List();\nstuff.add(3);\nstuff.add(&quot;apple&quot;);  // this is still totally legit because of the &lt;dynamic&gt; type\n</code></pre>\n<p>Want to know more about lists in Dart? Check out the <a href=\"https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.8.4/dart-core/List-class.html\">API reference here!</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"objectmap\">Object 👉Map</h3>\n<p>Now that we’ve covered arrays, we can move on to objects. In JavaScript, objects store <strong>key-value pairs</strong>, and the closest we can get to this data structure in Dart is a <code>Map</code>. Just like we saw at the List, we can define a Map both with the <code>{ ... }</code> literal and with the <code>new Map()</code> constructor.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">// the usual { ... } literal\nvar notesAboutDart = {\n    objects: &quot;hey look ma! just like in JS!&quot;,\n    otherStuff: &quot;idc we’ll look into them later&quot;\n};\n\n// the new Map constructor\nMap notesAboutJs = new Map();\n\n// … and of course, you can explicitly type Maps!\n// typed Map literal:\nMap&lt;String, int&gt; prices = &lt;String, int&gt;{\n    &quot;apple&quot;: 100,\n    &quot;pear&quot;: 80,\n    &quot;watermelon&quot;: 400\n};\n\n// typed Map constructor:\nfinal Map&lt;String, String&gt; response = new Map&lt;String, String&gt;();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Knowing about these methods will be just enough for now - but if you want to get to know the advanced stuff like HashMaps right away, be sure to check out the <a href=\"https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.8.4/dart-core/Map-class.html\">API docs of the Map class</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"importsandexports\">Imports and exports</h2>\n<p>In JavaScript, you could simply expose values from your files with <code>export</code> or <code>module.exports</code> and refer to them in other files with <code>import</code> or <code>require(...)</code>. In Dart, it’s both a bit more complex and simpler than that.</p>\n<p>To simply import a library, you can use the <code>import</code> statement and refer to the core package name, a library name, or a path:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">import 'dart:math';  // import math from “math” 👉import “math”;\n\n// Importing libraries from external packages\nimport 'package:test/test.dart';  // import { test } from “test” 👉import “test/test”;\n\n// Importing files\nimport 'path/to/my_other_file.dart';  // this one is basically the same\n\n// Specifying a prefix\nimport 'dart:math' as greatMath;\n</code></pre>\n<p>But how about creating your own libraries or exporting stuff? Dart lacks the usual <code>public</code>, <code>protected</code> or <code>private</code> keywords that Java has for this purpose <em>(sidenote: Dart is compared to Java a lot of times)</em> and even the <code>export</code> keyword that we’re used to in JavaScript. Instead, every file is automatically a Dart library and that means that you can just write code without explicitly exporting stuff, import it in another file, and expect it to work out just fine.</p>\n<p>If you <strong>don’t</strong> want Dart to expose your variable, you can (and should!) use the <code>_</code> prefix. Here’s an example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">// /dev/a.dart\nString coolDudes = &quot;anyone reading this&quot;;\nString _hiddenSuffix = “...with sunglasses on 😎&quot;;\n\n// /dev/b.dart\nimport &quot;./b.dart&quot;;\n\nprint(&quot;cool dudes: $coolDudes&quot;); // =&gt; cool dudes: anyone reading this\nprint(&quot;cool dudes: $coolDudes $_hiddenSuffix&quot;) // =&gt; will fail as _hiddenSuffix is undefined in this context\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Oh, and just a quick note about naming variables: camelCasing is considered a best practice, just like capitalizing abbreviations longer than two characters (e.g. HTTP =&gt; Http,  or <code>HttpConnectionInfo</code>). To know more about writing efficient and stylish Dart code, make sure that you read the <a href=\"https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart\">Effective Dart guide</a> later on your journey, once you are confident with the basics.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"aquickintrotooopandclasses\">A quick intro to OOP and classes</h2>\n<p><strong>Dart is an object oriented language</strong> - but what does that mean for you?</p>\n<p>If you don’t know OOP yet, that means that you’ll have to learn a brand new paradigm of programming that is utilized in many popular languages like Java, C#, and of course, Dart. While introducing you to OOP isn’t the main goal of this series, I’ll provide you a quick intro so that you can start off with Dart and Flutter.</p>\n<p><strong>The first thing to settle is that JavaScript isn’t either strictly OOP nor functional</strong> - it contains elements from both architectures.</p>\n<p>It’s up to your preferences, the project you work on, and the desired target framework, to choose (if a strict decision is ever made) between the two concepts. On the other hand, Dart is <em>pretty</em> strict about being OOP.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/lPSAlzK2BgEfhyBuk7/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Beginner Dart Language Tutorial for JavaScript Developers\"></p>\n<p>Here’s a little chart I made to help you wrap your head around the main differences between functional and object-oriented programming:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/10/fpvsoop-dart-language-tutorial.png\" alt=\"Beginner Dart Language Tutorial for JavaScript Developers\"></p>\n<p>To sum up: before OOP, there was procedural programming. There were a bunch of variables and functions lying around - and it was simple, but if often led to <strong>spaghetti code</strong>. To solve this, engineers came up with OOP, where we group related functions and variables into a unit. This unit is called an object, and inside it there are variables called properties and functions called methods. While creating this unit, always try to be descriptive. To practice making up these units, you can come up with real-world objects around you and try to describe them with properties and methods.</p>\n<p>A car would, for example, have properties like their brand, color, weight, horse power, their license plate number and other stuff that can describe a car. Meanwhile it would have methods for acceleration, breaking, turning, etc.</p>\n<p>Of course, you don’t have cars inside your code, so let’s put that abstract idea into code! A great example of a unit inside JS would be the <code>window</code> object. It has properties like the width and height of the window and has methods for resizing and scrolling.</p>\n<p>The four principles of OOP are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> Group variables (properties) and functions (methods) into units called objects.This reduces complexity and increases reusability.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Abstraction:</strong> You should not be able to directly modify the properties or access all methods - instead, think of writing a simple interface for your object. This helps you isolate the impact of changes made inside the objects.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Inheritance:</strong> Eliminate redundant code by inheriting stuff from another object or class. (Dart achieves this with mixins - we’ll look into concrete examples later). This helps you keep your code base smaller and more maintainable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Polymorphism:</strong> Because of the inheritance, one thing can behave differently depending on the type of the referenced object. This helps you in refactoring and eliminating ugly <code>if</code>s and <code>switch/case</code> statements.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"reallifedartexamples\">Real-Life Dart Examples</h3>\n<p>If you are confused or intimidated by this concept, don’t worry. Looking at real-life Dart examples will help you wrap your head around this whole mess we call OOP. Let’s look at a simple class with some properties and a constructor.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">class Developer {\n  final String name;\n  final int experienceYears;\n\n  // Constructor with some syntactic sugar\n  // a constructor creates a new instance of the class\n  Developer(this.name, this.experienceYears) {\n    // The code you write here will run when you construct a new instance of the Developer class\n    // e.g. with the Developer dev = new Developer(“Daniel”, 12); syntax!\n    // Notice that you don't have to explicitly type\n    // this.name = name;\n    // one by one. This is because of a Dart syntactic sugar\n  }\n\n  int get startYear =&gt;\n      new DateTime.now().year - experienceYears; // read-only property\n\n  // Method\n  // notice the `void` as this returns nothing\n  void describe() {\n    print(\n        'The developer is $name. They have $experienceYears years of experience so they started development back in $startYear.');\n    if (startYear &gt; 3) {\n      print('They have plenty of experience');\n    } else {\n      print('They still have a lot to learn');\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And somewhere else in the code, you can construct a new instance of this class:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">void main() {\n  Developer peter = new Developer(&quot;Peter&quot;, 12);\n  Developer aaron = Developer(&quot;Aaron&quot;, 2); // in Dart 2, the new keyword is optional\n  peter.describe();\n  // this well print this to the console:\n  // The developer is Peter. They have 12 years of experience so they started development back in 2008.\n  // They have plenty of experience.\n\n  aaron.describe();\n  // =&gt;\n  // The developer is Aaron. They have 2 years of experience so they started development back in 2018.\n  // They still have a lot to learn.\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And that’s it! You’ve just made your first Dart class with properties and methods. You used typed variables, get-only (protected) variables, control flow statements, got the current year and printed some stuff out to the console.</p>\n<p>Congratulations! 🎉</p>\n<h3 id=\"inheritanceandmixinsindart\">Inheritance and mixins in Dart</h3>\n<p>Now while you have momentum, let’s have a peek at inheritance and mixins.</p>\n<p>Once you have a solid knowledge of classes and start to think of more complex systems, you’ll feel the need for some way to inherit code from one class to another without copying and pasting code all over the place and making a big ol’ bowl of spaghetti. ❌🍝</p>\n<p>For this reason, we have inheritance in OOP. When inheriting code from one class to another, you basically let the compiler copy and paste members of the class <em>(“members” of the class are methods and properties inside a class)</em>, and add additional code on top of the previous class. This is where polymorphism kicks in: the same core code can exist in multiple ways by inheriting from a base class <em>(the class you inherit from)</em>.</p>\n<p>Think of HTML. There are several similar elements that HTML implements, like a <code>TextBox</code>, a <code>Select</code> or a <code>Checkbox</code>. They all share some common methods and properties like the <code>click()</code>, <code>focus()</code>, <code>innerHTML</code>, or <code>hidden</code>. With class inheritance, you can write a common class like <code>HtmlElement</code> and inherit the repetitive code from there.</p>\n<p>How does this look in practice? In Dart, we use the <code>extends</code> keyword to inherit code from a base class. Let’s look at a short example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">// notice the extends keyword.\n// we refer to the Developer class we defined in the previous snippet\nclass RisingStackEngineer extends Developer {\n  final bool cool = true;\n  String sunglassType;\n  \n  RisingStackEngineer(String name, int experienceYears, this.sunglassType)\n      : super(name, experienceYears); // super() calls the parent class constructor\n  \n  void describeSunglasses() {\n    print(&quot;$name has some dope-ass $sunglassType-type sunglasses.&quot;);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And what can this class do? Let’s look at this snippet:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">void main() {\n  RisingStackEngineer berci = RisingStackEngineer(&quot;Bertalan&quot;, 300, &quot;cool&quot;);\n  berci.describe(); // .describe(); is not defined on the RisingStackEngineer class directly - it’s inherited from the Developer class. We can still use it though!\n  berci.describeSunglasses(); // =&gt; Bertalan has some dope-ass cool-type sunglasses\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Isn’t that amazing? Let’s make it even better with mixins. Mixins help you mix in more than one class into your hierarchy. For example, let’s give some keyboards for our developers:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">class Keyboard {\n  int numberOfKeys = 101;\n  void describeKeyboard() {\n    print(&quot;The keyboard has $numberOfKeys keys.&quot;);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And use a mixin to create some sort of developer-keyboard hybrid person with Dart and the <code>with</code> keyword:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">class WalkingKeyboard extends Developer with Keyboard {\n  // ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And that’s it! If you want to practice Dart before we move on to our last topic for today (asynchronous programming), be sure to play around with <a href=\"https://dartpad.dev\">DartPad</a>, an online compiler made by the Dart team.</p>\n<p>Write some statements, create some classes and maybe even inherit some code. Don’t just read - pause this article and write some code! Once you feel comfortable with these base concepts (typing your variables, writing lists, maps, using control flow statements, creating classes), we’ll move forward to asynchronous programming with Dart.</p>\n<h2 id=\"asynchronousprogramminginthedartlangauge\">Asynchronous programming in the Dart Langauge</h2>\n<p>Writing asynchronous code is a must when communicating with a server, working with files, or using some native APIs. In JavaScript, we had callbacks and <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> for timing our code. To our luck, <strong>Dart utilizes the very same concepts</strong> and embraces <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> to avoid callback hell.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at a callback example first:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">// Promise 👉 Future\n// the method return type is an asynchronous void\nFuture&lt;void&gt; printWithDelay(String message) {\n  // Future.delayed delays the code run with the specified duration\n  return Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1)).then((_) {\n    print(message);\n  });\n}\n\nvoid main() {\n  print(&quot;hey hi hello&quot;);\n  printWithDelay(&quot;this message is printed with delay&quot;);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And look at the very same code with <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">// notice that you have to add in the async keyword to be able to await a Future\nFuture&lt;void&gt; printWithDelay(String message) async {\n  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1));\n  print(message);\n}\n\nvoid main() {\n  print(&quot;hey hi hello&quot;);\n  printWithDelay(&quot;this message is printed with delay&quot;);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And that was it for the Promise 👉 Future part. If you’d like to know more about the Future API, be sure to <a href=\"https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.8.4/dart-async/Future-class.html\">read the documentation</a>. But stay tuned! Dart has another API for handling asynchrony: Streams. 🤯</p>\n<h3 id=\"streamsinthedartlanguage\">Streams in the Dart Language</h3>\n<p>Dart’s main advancement in asynchrony compared to many other languages is native support for streams. If you want to have a simple way to wrap your head around the difference between Futures and Streams, think of the following: <code>Future</code> handles “finished future” <em>(e.g. a web API response)</em> with a single value, while Streams handle continuous future <em>(e.g. an asynchronous for loop)</em> with zero or more values.</p>\n<p>Consider the following chart:<br>\n<img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/10/futurevsstream-dart-language-tutorial.png\" alt=\"Beginner Dart Language Tutorial for JavaScript Developers\"></p>\n<p>How do you work with data received from Dart Streams? Whenever a new event happens in the stream (either new data is received or an error happened), Dart notifies a <strong>listener</strong>. A listener is a snippet of code that subscribes for events of a stream and processes data whenever an event is received. You can subscribe to a stream with the <code>.listen()</code> function, provide a callback and boom, there you go! Isn’t that easy? 🤩 Let’s look at an example to get the hang of it:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">// this is an imaginative stream that gives us an integer every one second\nfinal exampleStream = NumberCreator().stream;\n// e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, ...\n\n// print the data received from the stream\nfinal subscription = exampleStream.listen((data) =&gt; print(data););\n</code></pre>\n<p>By default, Dart streams only support one listener. Adding another listener to this stream would throw an exception - however, there is a tool that helps us adding multiple listeners to a single stream. <strong>Broadcast streams!</strong> You can just throw in <code>.asBroadcastStream</code> at the end of your stream and you’ll be able to add multiple listeners to your stream:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">// same code but with a broadcast stream. Notice the .asBroadcastStream at the end!\nfinal exampleStream = NumberCreator().stream.asBroadcastStream;\n\n// and you’ll be fine adding multiple listeners\nfinal subscription = exampleStream.listen((data) =&gt; print(data););\nfinal subscription2 = exampleStream.listen((data) =&gt; print(data););\n</code></pre>\n<p>But while we’re at listeners, let’s have a closer look at that API. I mentioned that you could either receive data or an error in a stream: how can you handle errors? I made a bit more advanced listener with error handling below. You can also run code when a stream finishes sending data (won’t send data anymore), you can explicitly define if you want to cancel listening when an error occurs, and a lot more. Here’s the code:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">final advancedSubscription = exampleStream.listen(\n    // this runs when new data is received\n    (data) {\n        print(&quot;data: $data&quot;);\n    },\n\n    // handle errors when one occurs\n    onError: (err) {\n        print(&quot;error: $err&quot;);\n    },\n\n    // do not cancel the subscription when an error occurs\n    cancelOnError: false,\n\n    // when the stream finishes, run some code.\n    onDone: () {\n        print(&quot;done!&quot;);\n    }\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Oh, and if this wouldn’t be enough for you, you can do stuff with the subscription object itself too:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-dart\">advancedSubscription.pause(); // pause the subscription\nadvancedSubscription.resume(); // resume the subscription\nadvancedSubscription.cancel(); // remove/cancel the subscription\n</code></pre>\n<p>There is still a lot more that can be done with streams in Dart: you can manipulate them, filter their data, and of course, we didn’t have a look at asynchronous iterators and creating streams - however, this should be just enough for you to start development with Flutter.</p>\n<p>If you want to know more about asynchrony in Dart, check out the following videos made by the Flutter team:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/vl_AaCgudcY\">Isolates and event loops</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/OTS-ap9_aXc\">Dart Futures</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/nQBpOIHE4eE\">Dart Streams</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/SmTCmDMi4BY\">Async/Await</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/TF-TBsgIErY\">Generators</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>And that’s it for asynchronous programming  - for now!</p>\n<h2 id=\"summingourbeginnerdarttutorialup\">Summing our beginner Dart tutorial up</h2>\n<p>Congratulations on making it this far into the course! 🎉 If it was a bit dry or heavy for you, don’t worry: this was a Dart-only episode. In this episode, we looked at a crap ton of stuff! We went from variables, types, and control flow statements to lists, maps, imports, and exports.</p>\n<p>Then, we came to the heavier parts of the Dart ecosystem. We first had a look at why OOP exists, what are its pros, where it performs well, and then we looked at classes, inheritance, and mixins, and if that wouldn’t be enough, we even looked at asynchrony, callbacks, async/await and streams.</p>\n<p>Don’t forget: if you want to practice all these new stuff we just learned about, you can always hit up <a href=\"https://dartpad.dev\">DartPad</a> and play around with it for a bit. <em>(I even encourage you to do so as you’ll need to have a strong Dart knowledge to move on to Flutter).</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/flutter-crash-course-javascript/\">In the next episode, we’ll look into Flutter</a>: we’ll start with the CLI and a hello world app, and have a look at widgets, lists, styling, state management, props, routing, and networking - and in the last episode, we’ll put it all together and build a fun game.

That part is very well written in the original tutorial, and I would like to be neither repetitive nor plagiarize Auth0's content, so please go ahead and read the <a href=\"https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/vuejs/01-login#configure-auth0\">first section there</a>, then come back.</p>\n<h2 id=\"createasampleapplication\">Create a Sample Application</h2>\n<p>Now we already start to diverge from the Auth0 tutorial.</p>\n<p>If you already have an existing app, make sure that <code>typescript</code>, <code>vue-class-component</code>, and <code>vue-property-decorator</code> are present in your <code>package.json</code>, as we'll use <a href=\"https://class-component.vuejs.org/\">class components</a>.</p>\n<p>If you don't have one, let's create a sample app.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">$ vue create auth0-ts-vue\n</code></pre>\n<p>When prompted, select <code>Manually select features</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/08/Auth0-TypeScript-Manually-select-features.png\" alt=\"Auth0: Vue & TypeScript Quickstart SDK - The Missing Docs\"></p>\n<p>We'll need <code>Babel</code>, <code>TypeScript</code>, and <code>Router</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/08/auth0-Babel-TypeScript-Router.png\" alt=\"Auth0: Vue & TypeScript Quickstart SDK - The Missing Docs\"></p>\n<p>The next 3 questions are about deciding whether you want to use class-style component syntax, Babel, and history mode. Hit enter for all three to answer &quot;Yes&quot;. You might opt-out from history mode if you really want to.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/08/Auth0-typescript-use-defaults.png\" alt=\"Auth0: Vue & TypeScript Quickstart SDK - The Missing Docs\"></p>\n<p>It is entirely up to you if you want to use dedicated config files or not, and if you want to save this as a preset.</p>\n<p>Grab a beverage of your preference while the dependencies are being installed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"installthesdk\">Install the SDK</h3>\n<p>Once it's done, we need to install our auth0 dependencies.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">$ cd auth0-ts-vue-example\n$ npm install @auth0/auth0-spa-js\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>auth0-spa-js</code> package comes with its own type definitions, so we're all set for now.</p>\n<h3 id=\"modifyyourwebpackconfig\">Modify your Webpack Config</h3>\n<p>If you followed the original Auth0 tutorials configuration part, you've set up your URLs to listen at port 3000. Time to hard code this into our webpack dev-server.</p>\n<p>Create a <code>vue.config.js</code> file in the root directory of your app.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const webpack = require('webpack')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  devServer: {\n    port: 3000\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This way, we don't have to specify the <code>PORT</code> env var when we run our app. We'd need to change it in Auth0 anyway all the time, while we're developing it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"starttheapplication\">Start the application</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">$ npm run serve\n</code></pre>\n<p>Leave it running so we can leverage Webpack's incremental build throughout the process.</p>\n<h2 id=\"createanauthenticationwrapper\">Create an Authentication Wrapper</h2>\n<p>Have you ever created a Vue.js plugin? Well, now is the time!</p>\n<p>The easiest way to use Auth0 in your app is to make it available on <code>this</code> in each of your components, just as you do with <code>$route</code> after you've installed Vue Router.</p>\n<p>It would be nice if this was a separate dependency, but for the sake of simplicity, let it live inside our codebase.</p>\n<p>Create a directory called <code>auth</code> inside your <code>src</code> dir then create the following files: <code>index.ts</code> <code>auth.ts</code>, <code>VueAuth.ts</code>, <code>User.ts</code>. The original tutorial has them all in one file. Still, in my opinion, it is easier to understand what's happening if we separate the matters a bit, and it also results in nicer type definitions too.</p>\n<p>Our <code>index.ts</code> will be a simple barrel file.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ts\">export * from './auth'\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>auth.ts</code> is where we define the plugin. <code>VueAuth.ts</code> is a wrapper Vue object around <code>auth0-spa-js</code>, so we can leverage the observability provided by Vue, and <code>User.ts</code> is a class to make its type definition nicer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"definingouruser\">Defining our User</h3>\n<p>Let's go from the inside out and take a look at <code>User.ts</code></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ts\">import { camelCase } from 'lodash'\n\nexport class User {\n  sub: string\n  names: string\n  nickname: string\n  picture: string\n  updatedAt: string\n  email: string\n  emailVerified: boolean\n\n  provider?: string\n  id?: string\n\n  givenName?: string\n  familyName?: string\n  locale?: string\n  [key: string]: string | boolean | undefined\n\n  constructor (auth0User: { [key: string]: string | boolean | undefined }) {\n    if (!auth0User) return\n    for (const key in auth0User) {\n      this[key] = auth0User[key]\n    }\n\n    this.sub = auth0User.sub as string\n    this.provider = this.sub.split('|')[0]\n    this.id = this.sub.split('|')[1]\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, this requires a bit of explanation. The first block of fields are the one that are always present, no matter what login scheme the user used. Sub is the <a href=\"https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken\">OpenID ID Token's</a> Subject Identifier, which contains the authentication provider (eg. auth0 or google) and the actual user id, separated by a <code>|</code>. The other mandatory fields are probably self-explanatory.</p>\n<p>Next are <code>provider</code> and <code>id</code>, which are a result of splitting <code>sub</code>, so they should be there, but we cannot be sure. The last are the ones that were only present when Google OAuth is used as the provider. There might be more, depending on what connections you set up and what other data you request. Or you could even code custom fields in the returned ID Token... but I digress.</p>\n<p>Last we tell TypeScript, that we want to be able to use the bracket notation on our object by adding <code>[key: string]: any</code></p>\n<p>Our constructor takes a raw user object with similar fields but <code>snake_cased</code>. That's why we camelCase them and assign each of them to our User object. Once we're done, we extract the provider and the id from the subfield.</p>\n<h3 id=\"showmethewrapper\">Show me the Wrapper</h3>\n<p>Time to take a look at <code>VueAuth.ts</code></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ts\">import { Vue, Component } from 'vue-property-decorator'\nimport createAuth0Client, { PopupLoginOptions, Auth0Client, RedirectLoginOptions, GetIdTokenClaimsOptions, GetTokenSilentlyOptions, GetTokenWithPopupOptions, LogoutOptions } from '@auth0/auth0-spa-js'\nimport { User } from './User'\n\nexport type Auth0Options = {\n  domain: string\n  clientId: string\n  audience?: string\n  [key: string]: string | undefined\n}\n\nexport type RedirectCallback = (appState) =&gt; void\n\n\n@Component({})\nexport class VueAuth extends Vue {\n  loading = true\n  isAuthenticated? = false\n  user?: User\n  auth0Client?: Auth0Client\n  popupOpen = false\n  error?: Error\n\n  async getUser () {\n    return new User(await this.auth0Client?.getUser())\n  }\n\n  /** Authenticates the user using a popup window */\n  async loginWithPopup (o: PopupLoginOptions) {\n    this.popupOpen = true\n\n    try {\n      await this.auth0Client?.loginWithPopup(o)\n    } catch (e) {\n      console.error(e)\n      this.error = e\n    } finally {\n      this.popupOpen = false\n    }\n\n    this.user = await this.getUser()\n    this.isAuthenticated = true\n  }\n\n  /** Authenticates the user using the redirect method */\n  loginWithRedirect (o: RedirectLoginOptions) {\n    return this.auth0Client?.loginWithRedirect(o)\n  }\n\n  /** Returns all the claims present in the ID token */\n  getIdTokenClaims (o: GetIdTokenClaimsOptions) {\n    return this.auth0Client?.getIdTokenClaims(o)\n  }\n\n  /** Returns the access token.

There you can find it as:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">  // The 'instance' is simply a Vue object\n  instance = new Vue({\n    ...\n  })\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now let's unpack it.</p>\n<p>First, we need to import a couple of types, including our User class.</p>\n<p>Then we create the <code>Auth0Options</code> and <code>RedirectCallback</code> type aliases for convenience.</p>\n<p>Instead of creating a simple Vue object, we define a Class Component. The public fields are the same as the <code>data</code> object in the original, whereas the static ones are the parameters passed to the plugin.</p>\n<p>We differ in two substantial way from the original tutorial:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We have one less method: <code>handleRedirectCallback</code> is not used anywhere in the original, so we omitted it.</li>\n<li>Instead of setting up the Auth0 Client in the Vue object's <code>created</code> hook, we use a separate method called <code>init</code>. Aside from that, the contents of the two are identical.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The reason for using a separate method is simple: The created hook is used in place of a constructor when it comes to Class Components, as the constructor of the class is usually called by Vue.</p>\n<p>First, a component object is created just like when using <code>Vue({})</code>, passing it the data, methods, watchers, paramlist, and all the things we usually define for components. When this is done, the <code>created</code> hook is called. Later, when the component is actually used and rendered, the params are passed to it, and <code>mounted</code>, or <code>updated</code>.</p>\n<p>The problem with the original one is that we cannot pass parameters to the <code>created</code> method. Neither can we write a proper constructor. So we need to have our own method we will call right after the object is instantiated just as it's done with <code>created</code> by Vue.</p>\n<p>Let's dissect <code>init</code> a bit.</p>\n<p>First, we create and <code>auth0Client</code>.</p>\n<p>Then, in the <code>try-catch</code> block, we check if the user is returning after authentication and handle it. We check if the query params contain any signs of redirection. If they do, we call <code>auth0Client.handleRedirectCallback</code>, which parses the URL and either rejects with an error or resolves with and appState.</p>\n<p>Then, we pass on the appState to <code>onRedirectCallback</code>. This is a function we can pass to the plugin when we install it to Vue, so we can handle the app level ramifications of a login.</p>\n<p>For the other methods, <code>getUser</code> is a simple wrapper around the authClient's <code>getUser</code> method. We pass on the resolved promise to our <code>User</code>'s constructor to create a nicely looking <code>User</code> object.</p>\n<p>Next, there is <code>loginWithPopup</code>, which we won't use, as popups can be blocked by browsers. So we'll go with the redirect way, where the user is redirected to Auth0, login, then the callback URL is called by Auth0 passing information to our app in the callback URL's query.</p>\n<p>The information in the URL is parsed by <code>auth0Client.handleRedirectCallback</code> which will return a <code>Promise&lt;RedirectCallbackResult&gt;</code>. The Promise will be rejected if there is an error in the authentication flow.</p>\n<p>We have a couple of simple wrappers around the <code>auth0Client</code>. <code>loginWithRedirect</code> initiates the flow I described above, <code>logout</code> speaks for itself.</p>\n<p>Finally, we set up the user and check if we're authenticated.</p>\n<h3 id=\"letsturnthisintoaplugin\">Let's turn this into a Plugin</h3>\n<p>Now, all we need to do is create a proper plugin.</p>\n<p>If you take a look at <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/plugins.html\">Vue's documentation about plugins</a>, you'll see that we need to create an object that exposes an <code>install</code> method. This method will be called when we pass the object to <code>Vue.use</code> and it will receive the <code>Vue</code> constructor and optionally... options.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ts\">type Auth0PluginOptions = {\n  onRedirectCallback: RedirectCallback,\n  redirectUri: string,\n  domain: string,\n  clientId: string,\n  audience?: string,\n  [key: string]: string | RedirectCallback | undefined\n}\n\nexport const Auth0Plugin = {\n  install (Vue: VueConstructor, options: Auth0PluginOptions) {\n    Vue.prototype.$auth = useAuth0(options)\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In our <code>install</code> method, we add an <code>$auth</code> member to any <code>Vue</code> object, so the <code>VueAuth</code> object is available everywhere, just as <code>vue-router</code> is.</p>\n<p>Let's implement the <code>useAuth</code> function.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ts\">/** Define a default action to perform after authentication */\nconst DEFAULT_REDIRECT_CALLBACK = () =&gt;\n  window.history.replaceState({}, document.title, window.location.pathname)\n\nlet instance: VueAuth\n\n/** Returns the current instance of the SDK */\nexport const getInstance = () =&gt; instance\n\n/** Creates an instance of the Auth0 SDK. If one has already been created, it returns that instance */\nexport const useAuth0 = ({\n  onRedirectCallback = DEFAULT_REDIRECT_CALLBACK,\n  redirectUri = window.location.origin,\n  ...options\n}) =&gt; {\n  if (instance) return instance\n\n  // The 'instance' is simply a Vue object\n  instance = new VueAuth()\n  instance.init(onRedirectCallback, redirectUri, options as Auth0Options)\n\n  return instance\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>useAuth</code> returns a singleton <code>VueAtuh</code> instance, and extracts the <code>onRedirectCallback</code> and <code>redirectUri</code> from the <code>options</code> object. What's left is an <code>Auth0Options</code> type which we'll pass on straight to the <code>auth0Client</code>.</p>\n<p>You can see the <code>init</code> method in action we created earlier. Then <code>VueAuth</code> is instantiated if it hasn't been already. Above that, we also expose a <code>getInstance</code> function, in case we need to use it outside of a Vue component.</p>\n<p>Let's see here the whole <code>auth.ts</code> for your copy-pasting convenience:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ts\">import { VueConstructor } from 'vue'\nimport { VueAuth, Auth0Options, RedirectCallback } from './VueAuth'\n\ntype Auth0PluginOptions = {\n  onRedirectCallback: RedirectCallback,\n  domain: string,\n  clientId: string,\n  audience?: string,\n  [key: string]: string | RedirectCallback | undefined\n}\n\n/** Define a default action to perform after authentication */\nconst DEFAULT_REDIRECT_CALLBACK = (appState) =&gt;\n  window.history.replaceState({}, document.title, window.location.pathname)\n\nlet instance: VueAuth\n\n/** Returns the current instance of the SDK */\nexport const getInstance = () =&gt; instance\n\n/** Creates an instance of the Auth0 SDK. If one has already been created, it returns that instance */\nexport const useAuth0 = ({\n  onRedirectCallback = DEFAULT_REDIRECT_CALLBACK,\n  redirectUri = window.location.origin,\n  ...options\n}) =&gt; {\n  if (instance) return instance\n\n  // The 'instance' is simply a Vue object\n  instance = new VueAuth()\n  instance.init(onRedirectCallback, redirectUri, options as Auth0Options)\n\n  return instance\n}\n\n// Create a simple Vue plugin to expose the wrapper object throughout the application\nexport const Auth0Plugin = {\n  install (Vue: VueConstructor, options: Auth0PluginOptions) {\n    Vue.prototype.$auth = useAuth0(options)\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, we're extending the <code>Vue</code> constructor with a new instance member. If we try to access it in a component, the TypeScript compiler will start crying as it has no idea what happened. We'll fix this a bit later down the line.</p>\n<p>Now, the <code>Auth0Options</code> are the ones that are needed for the client to identify your tenant. Copy the Client ID and Domain from your Auth0 applications settings and store them in a file called <code>auth.config.json</code> for now. It would be nicer to inject them as environment variables through webpack, but as these are not sensitive data, we'll be just fine like that as well.</p>\n<p>With all that said, I will not include my <code>auth.config.json</code> in the reference repo, only an example you'll need to fill in with your data.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  &quot;domain&quot;: &quot;your tenant's domain&quot;,\n  &quot;clientId&quot;: &quot;your app's clientId&quot;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Make sure to add <code>&quot;resolveJsonModule&quot;: true,</code> to your <code>tsconfig.json</code>.</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, we're ready to create our <code>main.ts</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ts\">import Vue from 'vue'\nimport App from './App.vue'\nimport router from './router'\nimport { Auth0Plugin } from './auth'\nimport { domain, clientId } from '../auth.config.json'\n\nVue.use(Auth0Plugin, {\n  domain,\n  clientId,\n  onRedirectCallback: (appState) =&gt; {\n    router.push(\n      appState &amp;&amp; appState.targetUrl\n        ? appState.targetUrl\n        : window.location.pathname\n    )\n  }\n})\n\nVue.config.productionTip = false\n\nnew Vue({\n  router,\n  render: h =&gt; h(App)\n}).$mount('#app')\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>onRedirectCallback</code> redirects the user to a protected route after they have authenticated. We'll cover this a bit later when we create an actual protected route.</p>\n<h2 id=\"logintotheapp\">Log in to the App</h2>\n<p>Time to put the authentication logic to use.</p>\n<p>First, we'll add a Login / Logout button to <code>Home.vue</code></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;div class=&quot;home&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;img alt=&quot;Vue logo&quot; src=&quot;../assets/logo.png&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;HelloWorld msg=&quot;Welcome to Your Vue.js App&quot; /&gt;\n\n    &lt;!-- Check that the SDK client is not currently loading before accessing is methods --&gt;\n    &lt;div v-if=&quot;!$auth.loading&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;!-- show login when not authenticated --&gt;\n      &lt;button v-if=&quot;!$auth.isAuthenticated&quot; @click=&quot;login&quot;&gt;Log in&lt;/button&gt;\n      &lt;!-- show logout when authenticated --&gt;\n      &lt;button v-if=&quot;$auth.isAuthenticated&quot; @click=&quot;logout&quot;&gt;Log out&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>We'll also need to update the logic in the <code>script</code> tag of <code>Home</code></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;script lang=&quot;ts&quot;&gt;\nimport { Component, Vue } from 'vue-property-decorator'\nimport HelloWorld from '@/components/HelloWorld.vue'\n\n@Component({\n  components: {\n    HelloWorld\n  }\n})\nexport default class Home extends Vue {\n  login () {\n    this.$auth.loginWithRedirect({})\n  }\n\n  // Log the user out\n  logout () {\n    this.$auth.logout({\n      returnTo: window.location.origin\n    })\n  }\n}\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>First, we turn the original example component into a Class Component. Second, the methods simply call the methods of <code>VueAuth</code> exposed by our <code>Auth0Plugin</code>.</p>\n<p>But what's that? <code>this.$auth</code> is probably underlined in your IDE. Or if you try to compile the code you'll get the following error:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/08/auth0-typescript-compile-error.png\" alt=\"Auth0: Vue & TypeScript Quickstart SDK - The Missing Docs\"></p>\n<p>Of course, we still have to tell the compiler that we have augmented the Vue constructor with our <code>$auth</code> member.</p>\n<p>Let's create a <code>shims-auth0.d.ts</code> file in our <code>src</code> directory. If you're using VSCode, you might need to reload the window to make the error go away.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ts\">import { VueAuth } from './auth/VueAuth'\ndeclare module 'vue/types/vue' {\n  interface Vue {\n    $auth: VueAuth\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Checkpoint</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now, let's try to compile our code. If you have configured your Auth0 credentials correctly, you should be redirected to the Auth0 Universal Login page when you click Login, and back to your app against once you have logged in.</p>\n<p>Then, you should be able to click Log out and have the application log you out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"displaytheusersprofile\">Display the User's Profile</h2>\n<p>So far so good, but let's try to create a protected route. Displaying the user's profile seems like a prime target for that.</p>\n<p>Let's create a file called <code>Profile.vue</code> in <code>src/views</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;img :src=&quot;$auth.user.picture&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;h2&gt;{{ $auth.user.name }}&lt;/h2&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;{{ $auth.user.email }}&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;pre&gt;{{ JSON.stringify($auth.user, null, 2) }}&lt;/pre&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>That's it. We read all the information we need from <code>$auth.user</code> we've already set up in <code>VueAuth.ts</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"addaroutetotheprofilecomponent\">Add a route to the Profile component</h3>\n<p>Let's update the app's routing configuration, so the users can access their profile.</p>\n<p>Open up <code>src/router/index.ts</code> and add the following to the <code>routes</code> array.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ts\">//.. other imports\n\n// NEW - Import the profile component\nimport Profile from &quot;../views/Profile.vue&quot;;\n\nVue.use(VueRouter)\n\nconst routes: Array&lt;RouteConfig&gt; = [\n  routes: [\n    // .. other routes and pages ..\n\n    // NEW - add the route to the /profile component\n    {\n      path: &quot;/profile&quot;,\n      name: &quot;profile&quot;,\n      component: Profile\n    }\n  ]\n});\n\nexport default router\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we need to update the navigation bar in <code>App.vue</code></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;div id=&quot;app&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;div id=&quot;nav&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;router-link to=&quot;/&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/router-link&gt; |\n      &lt;router-link to=&quot;/about&quot;&gt;About&lt;/router-link&gt;\n      &lt;span v-if=&quot;$auth.isAuthenticated&quot;&gt; |\n        &lt;router-link  to=&quot;/profile&quot;&gt;Profile&lt;/router-link&gt;\n      &lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;router-view/&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Checkpoint</strong></p>\n<p>The code should compile, so let's check if we can navigate to the Profile page and see the data. For added profit, try logging in with both Google and register a username and password. Take note of the data you get.</p>\n<h2 id=\"securetheprofilepage\">Secure the Profile Page</h2>\n<p>We have the route, time to make it protected. Let's create a new file in <code>src/auth</code> called <code>authGaurd.ts</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ts\">import { getInstance } from './auth'\nimport { NavigationGuard } from 'vue-router'\n\nexport const authGuard: NavigationGuard = (to, from, next) =&gt; {\n  const authService = getInstance()\n\n  const fn = () =&gt; {\n    // Unwatch loading\n    unwatch &amp;&amp; unwatch()\n    \n    // If the user is authenticated, continue with the route\n    if (authService.isAuthenticated) {\n      return next()\n    }\n\n    // Otherwise, log in\n    authService.loginWithRedirect({ appState: { targetUrl: to.fullPath } })\n  }\n\n  // If loading has already finished, check our auth state using `fn()`\n  if (!authService.loading) {\n    return fn()\n  }\n\n  // Watch for the loading property to change before we check isAuthenticated\n  const unwatch = authService.$watch('loading', (loading: boolean) =&gt; {\n    if (loading === false) {\n      return fn()\n    }\n  })\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>First, we put <code>auth.ts</code>'s <code>getInstance</code> to use. Then we create a function that checks if the user is authenticated. If they are, we call <code>next</code>, otherwise redirect them to login.</p>\n<p>However, we should only call this function, if the <code>authService</code> is not loading, as otherwise, we still don't have any settled information about the login process.</p>\n<p>If it is still loading, we set up a watcher for <code>authService.loading</code>, so when it turns <code>true</code>, we call our guard function. Also, please notice that we use the <code>unwatch</code> function returned by <code>$watch</code> to clean up after ourselves in <code>fn</code>.</p>\n<p>I personally prefer giving descriptive names to my functions, but I only wanted to change things for the sake of either type annotation, or stability, so forgive me for keeping <code>fn</code> as it is to maintain parity with the JS tutorial.</p>\n<h2 id=\"guidancewithauth0vuetypescript\">Guidance with Auth0, Vue &amp; TypeScript</h2>\n<p>Auth0 and all other authentication providers relieve us from the tedious job of handling user management ourselves. Auth0 itself excels in having a lot of educational resources for their users. The original Vue tutorial was really helpful, but seeing that TypeScript is becoming the industry standard when it comes to writing anything that should be run by JavaScript runtimes, it would be nice to see more TypeScript tutorials.</p>\n<p><strong>I hope this article manages to fill in a bit of this gap. If you liked what you just read, please share it with those who might need guidance with Auth0, Vue &amp; TypeScript!</strong></p>\n<p>Happy authenticating!</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Distributed Load Testing with Jmeter]]></title><description><![CDATA[Learn how to distribute and run Jmeter tests along multiple droplets on DigitalOcean using Terraform, Ansible, and bash scripting - to automate the process.]]></description><link>https://blog.risingstack.com/distributed-load-testing-with-jmeter/</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">5f045f8dbfd70d00011ad1b6</guid><category><![CDATA[DevOps Tutorials | @RisingStack]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[János Kubisch]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jul 2020 15:22:34 GMT</pubDate><media:content url=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/07/distributed-load-testing-jmeter.png\" medium=\"image\"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><img src=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/content/images/2020/07/distributed-load-testing-jmeter.png\" alt=\"Distributed Load Testing with Jmeter\"><p>Many of you have probably used apache Jmeter for load testing before. Still, it is easy to run into the limits imposed by running it on just one machine when trying to make sure that our API will be able to serve hundreds of thousands or even millions of users.</p>\n<p>We can get around this issue by deploying and running our tests to multiple machines in the cloud.</p>\n<p>In this article, we will take a look at one way to distribute and run Jmeter tests along multiple droplets on DigitalOcean using Terraform, Ansible, and a little bit of bash scripting to automate the process as much as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Background: During the COVID19 outbreak induced lockdowns, we’ve been tasked by a company (who builds an e-learning platform primarily for schools) to build out an infrastructure that is:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>geo redundant,</li>\n<li>supports both single and multi tenant deployments ,</li>\n<li>can be easily scaled to serve at least 1.5 million users in huge bursts,</li>\n<li>and runs on-premises.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To make sure the application is able to handle these requirements, we needed to set up the infrastructure, and model a reasonably high burst in requests to get an idea about the load the application and its underlying infrastructure is able to serve.</p>\n<p><strong>In this article, we’ll share practical advice and some of the scripts we used to automate the load-testing process using Jmeter, Terraform and Ansible.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"letsstart\">Let’s Start!</h2>\n<p>Have these tools installed before you begin!</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">brew install ansible\nbrew install terraform\nbrew install jmeter\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can just run them from your own machine. The full codebase is available on Github at <a href=\"https://github.com/RisingStack/distributed-loadtests-jmeter\">RisingStack/distributed-loadtests-jmeter</a> for your convenience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whydoweusejmeterfordistributedloadtesting\">Why do we use Jmeter for distributed load testing?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://jmeter.apache.org/\">Jmeter</a> is not my favorite tool for load testing owing mostly to the fact that scripting it is just awkward. But looking at the other tools that support distribution, it seems to be the best free one for now. <a href=\"https://k6.io/\">K6</a> looks good, but right now it does not support distribution outside the paid, hosted version. <a href=\"https://locust.io/\">Locust</a> is another interesting one, but it's focusing too much on random test picking, and if that's not what I'm looking for, it is quite awkward to use as well - just not flexible enough right now.</p>\n<p>So, back to Jmeter!</p>\n<p>Terraform is infrastructure as code, which allows us to describe the resources we want to use in our deployment and configure the droplets so we have them ready for running some tests. This will, in turn, be deployed by Ansible to our cloud service provider of choice, DigitalOcean - though with some changes, you can make this work with any other provider, as well as your on-premise machines if you wish so.</p>\n<h2 id=\"deployingtheinfrastructure\">Deploying the infrastructure</h2>\n<p>There will be two kinds of instances we'll use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>primary, of which we'll have one coordinating the testing,</li>\n<li>and runners, that we can have any number of.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the example, we're going to go with two, but we'll see that it is easy to change this when needed.</p>\n<p>You can check the <code>variables.tf</code> file to see what we'll use. You can use these to customise most aspects of the deployment to fit your needs. This file holds the vars that will be plugged into the other template files - main.tf and provider.tf.</p>\n<p>The one variable you'll need to provide to Terraform for the example setup to work is your DigitalOcean api token, that you can export like this from the terminal:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">export TF_VAR_do_token=DO_TOKEN\n</code></pre>\n<p>Should you wish to change the number of test runner instances, you can do so by exporting this other environment variable:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">export TF_VAR_instance_count=2\n</code></pre>\n<p>You will need to generate two ssh key pairs, one for the root user, and one for a non-privileged user. These will be used by Ansible, which uses ssh to deploy the testing infrastructure as it is agent-less. We will also use the non-privileged user when starting the tests for copying over files and executing commands on the primary node. The keys should be set up with correct permissions, otherwise, you'll just get an error.</p>\n<p>Set the permissions to 600 or 700 like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">chmod 600 /path/to/folder/with/keys/*\n</code></pre>\n<p>To begin, we should open a terminal in the terraform folder, and call <code>terraform init</code> which will prepare the working directory. Thisl needs to be called again if the configuration changes.</p>\n<p>You can use <code>terraform plan</code> that will output a summary of what the current changes will look like to the console to double-check if everything is right. At the first run, it will be what the deployment will look like.</p>\n<p>Next, we call <code>terraform apply</code> which will actually apply the changes according to our configuration, meaning we'll have our deployment ready when it finishes! It also generates a .tfstate file with all the information about said deployment.</p>\n<p>If you wish to dismantle the deployment after the tests are done, you can use <code>terraform destroy</code>. You'll need the .tfstate file for this to work though! Without the state file, you need to delete the created droplets by hand, and also remove the ssh key that has been added to DigitalOcean.</p>\n<h2 id=\"runningthejmetertests\">Running the Jmeter tests</h2>\n<p>The shell script we are going to use for running the tests is for convenience - it consists of copying the test file to our primary node, cleaning up files from previous runs, running the tests, and then fetching the results.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">#!/bin/bash\n\nset -e\n\n# Argument parsing, with options for long and short names\nfor i in &quot;$@&quot;\ndo\ncase $i in\n    -o=*|--out-file=*)\n    # i#*= This removes the shortest substring ending with\n    # '=' from the value of variable i - leaving us with just the\n    # value of the argument (i is argument=value)\n    OUTDIR=&quot;${i#*=}&quot;\n    shift\n    ;;\n    -f=*|--test-file=*)\n    TESTFILE=&quot;${i#*=}&quot;\n    shift\n    ;;\n    -i=*|--identity-file=*)\n    IDENTITYFILE=&quot;${i#*=}&quot;\n    shift\n    ;;\n    -p=*|--primary-ip=*)\n    PRIMARY=&quot;${i#*=}&quot;\n    shift\n    ;;\nesac\ndone\n\n# Check if we got all the arguments we'll need\nif [ -z &quot;$TESTFILE&quot; ] || [ ! -f &quot;$TESTFILE&quot; ]; then\n    echo &quot;Please provide a test file&quot;\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nif [ -z &quot;$OUTDIR&quot; ]; then\n    echo &quot;Please provide a result destination directory&quot;\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nif [ -z &quot;$IDENTITYFILE&quot; ]; then\n    echo &quot;Please provide an identity file for ssh access&quot;\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nif [ -z &quot;$PRIMARY&quot; ]; then\n  PRIMARY=$(terraform output primary_address)\nfi\n\n# Copy the test file to the primary node\nscp -i &quot;$IDENTITYFILE&quot; -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no &quot;$TESTFILE&quot; &quot;runner@$PRIMARY:/home/runner/jmeter/test.jmx&quot;\n# Remove files from previous runs if any, then run the current test\nssh -i &quot;$IDENTITYFILE&quot; -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no &quot;runner@$PRIMARY&quot; &lt;&lt; &quot;EOF&quot;\n rm -rf /home/runner/jmeter/result\n rm -f /home/runner/jmeter/result.log\n cd jmeter/bin ; ./jmeter -n -r -t ../test.jmx -l ../result.log -e -o ../result -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=$(hostname -I | awk ' {print $1}')\nEOF\n# Get the results\nscp -r -i &quot;$IDENTITYFILE&quot; -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no &quot;runner@$PRIMARY&quot;:/home/runner/jmeter/result &quot;$OUTDIR&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Running the script will require the path to the non-root ssh key. The call will look something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">bash run.sh -i=/path/to/non-root/ssh/key  -f=/path/to/test/file -o=/path/to/results/dir\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can also supply the IP of the primary node using <code>-p=</code> or <code>--primary-ip=</code> in case you don't have access to the .tfstate file. Otherwise, the script will ask terraform for the IP.</p>\n<p>Jmeter will then take care of distributing the tests across the runner nodes, and it will aggregate the data when they finish. The only thing we need to keep in mind is that the number of users we set for our test to use will <strong>not</strong> be split but will be multiplied. As an example, if you set the user count to 100, each runner node will then run the tests with 100 users.</p>\n<p>And that's how you can use Terraform and Ansible to run your distributed Jmeter tests on DigitalOcean!</p>\n<p><em>Check <a href=\"https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/string-manipulation.html\">this page</a> for more on string manipulation in bash.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"lookingfordevopsinfraexperts\">Looking for DevOps &amp; Infra Experts?</h2>\n<p>In case you’re looking for expertise in infrastructure related matters, I’d recommend to read our articles and ebooks on the topic, and to check out our various service pages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://risingstack.com/devops-sre-cloud-consulting-services\">DevOps, SRE &amp; Cloud Consulting Services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://risingstack.com/infrastructure-assessment-code-review-services\">Infrastructure Assessment and Code Review Services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://risingstack.com/kubernetes-consulting-training\">Kubernetes Consulting &amp; Training Services</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>An early draft of this article was written by Mate Boer, and then subsequently rewritten by Janos Kubisch - both engineers at RisingStack.</em></p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[About Async Iterators in Node.js]]></title><description><![CDATA[Async Iterators can be used when we don't know the values & end state we iterate over.

In this article, we’ll discuss what Async iterators do and we'll also tackle the question of what they could be used for.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatareasynciterators\">What are Async Iterators</h2>\n<p>So what are async iterators? They are practically the async versions of the previously available iterators. Async iterators can be used when we don't know the values and the end state we iterate over. Instead, we get promises that eventually resolve to the usual <code>{ value: any, done: boolean }</code> object. We also get the for-await-of loop to help us with looping over async iterators. That is just like the for-of loop is for synchronous iterators.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const asyncIterable = [1, 2, 3];\nasyncIterable[Symbol.asyncIterator] = async function*() {\n  for (let i = 0; i &lt; asyncIterable.length; i++) {\n    yield { value: asyncIterable[i], done: false }\n  }\n  yield { done: true };\n};\n\n(async function() {\n  for await (const part of asyncIterable) {\n    console.log(part);\n  }\n})();\n</code></pre>\n<p>The for-await-of loop will wait for every promise it receives to resolve before moving on to the next one, as opposed to a regular for-of loop.</p>\n<p>Outside of streams, there are not a lot of constructs that support async iteration currently, but the symbol can be added to any iterable manually, as seen here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"streamsasasynciterators\">Streams as async iterators</h2>\n<p>Async iterators are very useful when dealing with streams. Readable, writable, duplex, and transform streams all have the asyncIterator symbol out of the box.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">async function printFileToConsole(path) {\n  try {\n    const readStream = fs.createReadStream(path, { encoding: 'utf-8' });\n\n    for await (const chunk of readStream) {\n      console.log(chunk);\n    }\n\n    console.log('EOF');\n  } catch(error) {\n    console.log(error);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you write your code this way, you don't have to listen to the 'data' and 'end' events as you get every chunk by iterating, and the for-await-of loop ends with the stream itself.</p>\n<h2 id=\"consumingpaginatedapis\">Consuming paginated APIs</h2>\n<p>You can also fetch data from sources that use pagination quite easily using async iteration. To do this, we will also need a way to reconstruct the body of the response from the stream the Node https request method is giving us. We can use an async iterator here as well, as https requests and responses are streams in Node:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const https = require('https');\n\nfunction homebrewFetch(url) {\n  return new Promise(async (resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    const req = https.get(url, async function(res) {\n      if (res.statusCode &gt;= 400) {\n        return reject(new Error(`HTTP Status: ${res.statusCode}`));\n      }\n\n      try {\n        let body = '';\n\n        /*\n          Instead of res.on to listen for data on the stream,\n          we can use for-await-of, and append the data chunk\n          to the rest of the response body\n        */\n        for await (const chunk of res) {\n          body += chunk;\n        }\n    \n        // Handle the case where the response don't have a body\n        if (!body) resolve({});\n        // We need to parse the body to get the json, as it is a string\n        const result = JSON.parse(body);\n        resolve(result);\n      } catch(error) {\n        reject(error)\n      }\n    });\n\n    await req;\n    req.end();\n  });\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We are going to make our requests to the <a href=\"https://thecatapi.com/\">Cat API</a> to fetch some cat pictures in batches of 10. We will also include a 7-second delay between the requests and a maximum page number of 5 to avoid overloading the cat API as that would be CATtastrophic.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">function fetchCatPics({ limit, page, done }) {\n  return homebrewFetch(`https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search?limit=${limit}&amp;page=${page}&amp;order=DESC`)\n    .then(body =&gt; ({ value: body, done }));\n}\n\nfunction catPics({ limit }) {\n  return {\n    [Symbol.asyncIterator]: async function*() {\n      let currentPage = 0;\n      // Stop after 5 pages\n      while(currentPage &lt; 5) {\n        try {\n          const cats = await fetchCatPics({ currentPage, limit, done: false });\n          console.log(`Fetched ${limit} cats`);\n          yield cats;\n          currentPage ++;\n        } catch(error) {\n          console.log('There has been an error fetching all the cats!');\n          console.log(error);\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  };\n}\n\n(async function() {\n  try {\n    for await (let catPicPage of catPics({ limit: 10 })) {\n      console.log(catPicPage);\n      // Wait for 7 seconds between requests\n      await new Promise(resolve =&gt; setTimeout(resolve, 7000));\n    }\n  } catch(error) {\n    console.log(error);\n  }\n})()\n</code></pre>\n<p>This way, we automatically get back a pageful of cats every 7 seconds to enjoy.</p>\n<p>A more common approach to navigation between pages might be to implement a <code>next</code> and a <code>previous</code> method and expose these as controls:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">function actualCatPics({ limit }) {\n  return {\n    [Symbol.asyncIterator]: () =&gt; {\n      let page = 0;\n      return {\n        next: function() {\n          page++;\n          return fetchCatPics({ page, limit, done: false });\n        },\n        previous: function() {\n          if (page &gt; 0) {\n            page--;\n            return fetchCatPics({ page, limit, done: false });\n          }\n          return fetchCatPics({ page: 0, limit, done: true });\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  };\n}\n\ntry {\n    const someCatPics = actualCatPics({ limit: 5 });\n    const { next, previous } = someCatPics[Symbol.asyncIterator]();\n    next().then(console.log);\n    next().then(console.log);\n    previous().then(console.log);\n} catch(error) {\n  console.log(error);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, async iterators can be quite useful when you have pages of data to fetch or something like infinite scrolling on the UI of your application.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In case you're looking for a battle-tested Node.js team to build your product, or extend your engineering team, be kind and consider RisingStack's services: <a href=\"https://risingstack.com/nodejs-development-consulting-services\">https://risingstack.com/nodejs-development-consulting-services</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These features have been available in browsers for some time as well, in Chrome since version 63, in Firefox since version 57 and in Safari since version 11.1.

Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time to keep up with the blooming community in the last couple of months.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m happy to announce, that this situation ends today!</strong></p>\n<p>React Easy State just got moved under RisingStack and receives company support from now on.

In practical terms: it automagically decides when to render which components without explicit orders from you.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import React from 'react';\nimport { store, view } from 'react-easy-state';\n\nconst counter = store({\n  num: 0,\n  increment: () =&gt; counter.num++\n});\n\n// this component re-render's when counter.num changes\nexport default view(() =&gt; (\n  &lt;button onClick={counter.increment}&gt;{counter.num}&lt;/button&gt;\n));\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"whyshouldiuseit\">Why should I use it?</h2>\n<p>Transparent reactivity is not a new idea, Vue and React's Mobx are popular libraries that implement it. So how does Easy State differ from these?</p>\n<h3 id=\"thetechnicaledge\">The technical edge</h3>\n<p>Historically, transparent reactivity libraries could only work with basic get and set operations. Slightly more complex use cases - like arrays or <code>delete</code> operations - required special handling, which killed the 'transparent vibe'. Then came Proxies, a meta-programming addition to JavaScript.</p>\n<p>Proxies can intercept language operations which were not previously possible. They gave a huge boost to transparent reactivity libraries and both MobX and Vue embraced them since.</p>\n<p>Instead of embracing them, <a href=\"https://github.com/nx-js/observer-util\">Easy State's core</a> was born out of Proxies 4 years ago, back when they were an experimental API in Chrome only. It is not carrying any bloat from the pre-proxy era and it had a long time to mature during those 4 years. This advantage is noticeable both in the minimalistic API and the stability of the library.</p>\n<p>Check out how it holds up against exotic language operations in my <a href=\"https://medium.com/@solkimicreb/stress-testing-react-easy-state-ac321fa3becf\">Stress Testing React Easy State</a> article.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practicalsimplicity\">Practical simplicity</h3>\n<p>The everyday API consists of two functions only. The rest is automagic and contextual clues to let you focus on business logic instead of reading docs.</p>\n<p>Handling global state in React was always a bit clumsy. With Easy State you can create both global and local state with the same API by placing the state accordingly.</p>\n<p><strong>Global state</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import React from 'react';\nimport { store, view } from 'react-easy-state';\n\n// this state is defined globally and can be shared between components\nconst counter = store({\n  num: 0,\n  increment: () =&gt; counter.num++\n});\n\nexport default view(() =&gt; (\n  &lt;button onClick={counter.increment}&gt;{counter.num}&lt;/button&gt;\n));\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Local state</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import React from 'react';\nimport { store, view } from 'react-easy-state';\n\nexport default view(() =&gt; {\n  // this state is defined inside the component and it is local to the component\n  const counter = store({\n    num: 0,\n    increment: () =&gt; counter.num++\n  });\n\n  return (&lt;button onClick={counter.increment}&gt;{counter.num}&lt;/button&gt;);\n});\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"sowhymoveunderrisingstack\">So why move under RisingStack?</h2>\n<p>How does an already stable library benefit from RisingStack's support? The core is pretty much 'done', it didn't need any commits for the last 13 months. The React port - which is React Easy State - is a different story though. You probably know that React is in the middle of an exciting transition period with hooks and the upcoming async API.

However, the problem with bash scripts is that they are quite difficult to read, but more importantly, using bash scripts is a completely imperative way.</p>\n<p>When relying on bash scripts, implementation details or small differences between machine states can break the configuration process. There’s also the question of what happens if someone SSH-s into the server, configures something through the command line, then later someone would try to run a script, expecting the old state.</p>\n<p>The script might run successfully, simply break, or things could completely go haywire. No one can tell.</p>\n<p>To alleviate the pain caused by the drawbacks of defining our server configurations by bash scripts, we needed a declarative way to apply idempotent changes to the servers’ state, meaning that it does not matter how many times we run our script, it should always result in reaching the exact same expected state.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is the idea behind the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) concept: handling the state of infrastructure through idempotent changes, defined with an easily readable, domain-specific language.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"whatarethesedeclarativeapproaches\">What are these declarative approaches?</h3>\n<p>First, Puppet was born, then came Chef. Both of them were responses to the widespread adoption of using clusters of virtual machines that need to be configured together.</p>\n<p>Both Puppet and Chef follow the so-called “pull-based” method of configuration management. This means that you define the configuration - using their respective domain-specific language-  which is stored on a server. When new machines are spun up, they need to have a configured client that pulls the configuration definitions from the server and applies it to itself.</p>\n<p>Using their domain-specific language was definitely clearer and more self-documenting than writing bash scripts. It is also convenient that they apply the desired configuration automatically after spinning up the machines.</p>\n<p>However, one could argue that the need for a preconfigured client makes them a bit clumsy. Also, the configuration of these clients is still quite complex, and if the master node which stores the configurations is down, all we can do is to fall back to the old command line / bash script method if we need to quickly update our servers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toavoidasinglepointoffailureansiblewascreated\">To avoid a single point of failure, Ansible was created.</h2>\n<p>Ansible, like Puppet and Chef, sports a declarative, domain-specific language, but in contrast to them, Ansible follows a “push-based” method. That means that as long as you have Python installed, and you have an SSH server running on the hosts you wish to configure, you can run Ansible with no problem. We can safely say that expecting SSH connectivity from a server is definitely not inconceivable.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Long story short, Ansible gives you a way to push your declarative configuration to your machines.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Later came SaltStack. It also follows the push-based approach, but it comes with a lot of added features, and with it, a lot of added complexity both usage, and maintenance-wise.</p>\n<p><strong>Thus, while Ansible is definitely not the most powerful of the four most common solutions, it is hands down the easiest to get started with, and it should be sufficient to cover 99% of conceivable use-cases.</strong></p>\n<p>If you’re just getting started in the world of IaC, Ansible should be your starting point, so let’s stick with it for now.</p>\n<h3 id=\"otheriactoolsyoushouldknowabout\">Other IaC tools you should know about</h3>\n<p>While the above mentioned four (Pupper, Chef, Salt, Ansible) handles the configuration of individual machines in bulk, there are other IaC tools that can be used in conjunction with them. Let’s quickly list them for the sake of completeness, and so that you don’t get lost in the landscape.</p>\n<p><strong>Vagrant:</strong> It has been around for quite a while. Contrary to Puppet, Chef, Ansible, and Salt, Vagrant gives you a way to create blueprints of virtual machines. This also means that you can only create VMs using Vagrant, but you cannot modify them. So it can be a useful companion to your favorite configuration manager, to either set up their client, or SSH server, to get them started.</p>\n<p><strong>Terraform:</strong> Vagrant comes handy before you can use Ansible, if you maintain your own fleet of VMs. If you’re in the cloud, Terraform can be used to declaratively provision VMs, setup networks, or basically anything you can handle with the UI, API, or CLI of your favorite cloud provider. Feature support may vary, depending on the actual provider, and they mostly come with their own IaC solutions as well, but if you prefer not to be locked in to a platform, Terraform might be the best solution to go with.</p>\n<p><strong>Kubernetes:</strong> Container orchestration systems are considered Infrastructure as Code, as especially with Kubernetes, you have control over the internal network, containers, a lot of aspects of the actual machines, basically it’s more like an OS on it’s own right than anything. However, it requires you to have a running cluster of VMs with Kubernetes installed and configured.</p>\n<p>All in all, you can use either Vagrant or Terraform to lay the groundwork for your fleet of VMs, then use Ansible, Puppet, Chef or Salt to handle their configuration continuously. Finally, Kubernetes can give you a way to orchestrate your services on them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Are you looking for expert help with infrastructure related issues or project?

In Ansible’s terminology, the list of hosts is called an <strong>inventory</strong>.</p>\n<p>The machine that reads the definition files and runs Ansible to push the configuration to the hosts is called a <strong>control node</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoinstallansible\">How to Install Ansible</h2>\n<p>It is enough to install Ansible only on one machine, the control node.</p>\n<p>Control node requirements are the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Python 2 (version 2.7) or Python 3 (versions 3.5 and higher) installed</li>\n<li>Windows is not supported as a control node, but you can set it up on Windows 10 using <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10\">WSL</a></li>\n<li>Managed nodes also need Python to be installed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"rhelandcentos\">RHEL and CentOS</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">sudo yum install ansible\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"debianbaseddistrosandwsl\">Debian based distros and WSL</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">sudo apt update\nsudo apt install software-properties-common\nsudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible\nsudo apt install ansible\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"macos\">MacOS</h3>\n<p>The preferred way to install Ansible on a Mac is via <code>pip</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">pip install --user ansible\n</code></pre>\n<p>Run the following command to verify the installation:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">ansible --version\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"ansiblesetupconfigurationandautomation\">Ansible Setup, Configuration, and Automation</h2>\n<p>For the purposes of this tutorial, we’ll set up a Raspberry Pi with Ansible, so even if the SD card gets corrupted, we can quickly set it up again and continue working with it.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Flash image (Raspbian)</li>\n<li>Login with default credentials (pi/raspberry)</li>\n<li>Change default password</li>\n<li>Set up passwordless SSH</li>\n<li>Install packages you want to use</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>With Ansible, we can automate the process.</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s say we have a couple of Raspberry Pis, and after installing the operating system on them, we need the following packages to be installed on all devices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>vim</li>\n<li>wget</li>\n<li>curl</li>\n<li>htop</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We could install these packages one by one on every device, but that would be tedious. Let Ansible do the job instead.</p>\n<p>First, we’ll need to create a project folder.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">mkdir bootstrap-raspberry &amp;&amp; cd bootstrap-raspberry\n</code></pre>\n<p>We need a config file and a hosts file. Let’s create them.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">touch ansible.cfg\ntouch hosts \t\t// file extension not needed \n</code></pre>\n<p>Ansible can be configured using a config file named <code>ansible.cfg</code>. You can find an example with all the options <a href=\"https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/examples/ansible.cfg\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Security risk</strong>: if you load <code>ansible.cfg</code> from a world-writable folder, another user could place their own config file there and run malicious code. More about that <a href=\"https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/config.html#avoiding-security-risks-with-ansible-cfg-in-the-current-directory\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The lookup order of the configuration file will be searched for in the following order:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>ANSIBLE_CONFIG</code> (environment variable if set)</li>\n<li><code>ansible.cfg</code> (in the current directory)</li>\n<li><code>~/.ansible.cfg</code> (in the home directory)</li>\n<li><code>/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>So if we have an <code>ANSIBLE_CONFIG</code> environment variable, Ansible will ignore all the other files(2., 3., 4.). On the other hand, if we don’t specify a config file, <code>/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg</code> will be used.</p>\n<p>Now we’ll use a very simple config file with contents below:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">[defaults]\ninventory = hosts\nhost_key_checking = False\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here we tell Ansible that we use our <code>hosts</code> file as an inventory and to not check host keys. Ansible has host key checking enabled by default. If a host is reinstalled and has a different key in the <code>known_hosts</code> file, this will result in an error message until corrected. If a host is not initially in <code>known_hosts</code> this will result in prompting for confirmation interactively which is not favorable if you want to automate your processes.</p>\n<p>Now let’s open up the <code>hosts</code> file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">[raspberries]\n192.168.0.74\n192.168.0.75\n192.168.0.76\n\n[raspberries:vars]\nansible_connection=ssh  \nansible_user=pi \nansible_ssh_pass=raspberry\n</code></pre>\n<p>We list the IP address of the Raspberry Pis under the <code>[raspberries]</code> block and then assign variables to them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>ansible_connection</code>: Connection type to the host. Defaults to <code>ssh</code>. See other connection types <a href=\"https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/connection.html\">here</a></li>\n<li><code>ansible_user</code>: The user name to use when connecting to the host</li>\n<li><code>ansible_ssh_password</code>: The password to use to authenticate to the host</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"creatinganansibleplaybook\">Creating an Ansible Playbook</h2>\n<p>Now we’re done with the configuration of Ansible. We can start setting up the tasks we would like to automate. Ansible calls the list of these tasks “playbooks”.</p>\n<p>In our case, we want to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Change the default password,</li>\n<li>Add our SSH public key to <code>authorized_keys</code>,</li>\n<li>Install a few packages.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Meaning, we’ll have 3 tasks in our playbook that we’ll call <code>pi-setup.yml</code>.</p>\n<p>By default, Ansible will attempt to run a playbook on all hosts in parallel, but the tasks in the playbook are run serially, one after another.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at our <code>pi-setup.yml</code> as an example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">- hosts: all\n  become: 'yes'\n  vars:\n    user:\n      - name: &quot;pi&quot;\n        password: &quot;secret&quot;\n        ssh_key: &quot;ssh-rsa …&quot;\n    packages:\n      - vim\n      - wget\n      - curl\n      - htop\n  tasks:\n    - name: Change password for default user\n      user:\n        name: '&quot;{{ item.name }}&quot;'\n        password: '&quot;{{ item.password | password_hash('sha512') }}&quot;'\n        state: present\n      loop:\n        - '&quot;{{ user }}&quot;'\n    - name: Add SSH public key\n      authorized_key:\n        user: '&quot;{{ item.name }}&quot;'\n        key: '&quot;{{ item.ssh_key }}&quot;'\n      loop:\n        - '&quot;{{ user }}&quot;'\n    - name: Ensure a list of packages installed\n      apt:\n        name: '&quot;{{ packages }}&quot;'\n        state: present\n    - name: All done!\n      debug:\n        msg: Packages have been successfully installed\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"tearingdownouransibleplaybookexample\">Tearing down our Ansible Playbook Example</h2>\n<p>Let’s tear down this playbook.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">- hosts: all\n  become: 'yes'\n  vars:\n    user:\n      - name: &quot;pi&quot;\n        password: &quot;secret&quot;\n        ssh_key: &quot;ssh-rsa …&quot;\n    packages:\n      - vim\n      - wget\n      - curl\n      - htop\n  tasks:  [ … ]\n</code></pre>\n<p>This part defines fields that are related to the whole playbook:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>hosts: all</code>: Here we tell Ansible to execute this playbook on all hosts defined in our hostfile.</li>\n<li><code>become: yes</code>: Execute commands as sudo user. Ansible uses <a href=\"https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/become.html\">privilege escalation systems</a> to execute tasks with root privileges or with another user’s permissions. This lets you <em>become</em> another user, hence the name.</li>\n<li><code>vars</code>: User defined variables. Once you’ve defined variables, you can use them in your playbooks using the <a href=\"https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_templating.html\">Jinja2 templating system</a>.There are other sources <code>vars</code> can come from, such as variables discovered from the system. These variables are called <a href=\"https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#variables-discovered-from-systems-facts\">facts</a>.</li>\n<li><code>tasks</code>: List of commands we want to execute</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let’s take another look at the first task we defined earlier without addressing the user modules’ details. Don’t fret if it’s the first time you hear the word “module” in relation to Ansible, we’ll discuss them in detail later.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">tasks:\n  - name: Change password for default user\n    user:\n      name: '&quot;{{ item.name }}&quot;'\n      password: '&quot;{{ item.password | password_hash('sha512') }}&quot;'\n      state: present\n    loop:\n      - '&quot;{{ user }}&quot;'\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><code>name</code>: Short description of the task making our playbook self-documenting.</li>\n<li><code>user</code>: The module the task at hand configures and runs. Each module is an object encapsulating a desired state. These modules can control system resources, services, files or basically anything. For example, the documentation for the <code>user</code> module can be found  <a href=\"https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/user_module.html\">here</a>. It is used for managing user accounts and user attributes.</li>\n<li><code>loop</code>: Loop over variables. If you want to repeat a task multiple times with different inputs, <a href=\"https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_loops.html\"><code>loops</code></a> come in handy. Let’s say we have 100 users defined as variables and we’d like to register them. With loops, we don’t have to run the playbook 100 times, just once.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"understandingtheansibleusermodule\">Understanding the Ansible User Module</h2>\n<p>Zooming in on the user module:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">user:\n  name: '&quot;{{ item.name }}&quot;'\n  password: '&quot;{{ item.password | password_hash('sha512') }}&quot;'\n  state: present\nloop:\n  - '&quot;{{ user }}&quot;'\n</code></pre>\n<p>Ansible comes with a number of modules, and each module encapsulates logic for a specific task/service. The user module above defines a user and its password. It doesn’t matter if it has to be created or if it’s already present and only its password needs to be changed, Ansible will handle it for us.</p>\n<p>Note that Ansible will only accept hashed passwords, so either you provide pre-hashed characters or - as above - use a hashing <a href=\"https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_filters.html\">filter</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Are you looking for expert help with infrastructure related issues or project?

Instead, you can use variable flags when running the playbook from CLI or use a password store such as <a href=\"https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html\">Ansible Vault</a> or the <a href=\"https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/lookup/onepassword.html\">1Password module</a> .</p>\n<p>Most modules expose a <code>state</code> parameter, and it is best practice to explicitly define it when it’s possible. State defines whether the module should make something present (add, start, execute) or absent (remove, stop, purge). Eg. create or remove a user, or start / stop / delete a Docker container.</p>\n<p>Notice that the user module will be called at each iteration of the loop, passing in the current value of the <code>user</code> variable . The loop is not part of the module, it’s on the outer indentation level, meaning it’s task-related.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theauthorizedkeysmodule\">The Authorized Keys Module</h2>\n<p>The <code>authorized_keys</code> module adds or removes SSH authorized keys for a particular user’s account, thus enabling passwordless SSH connection.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">- name: Add SSH public key\n  authorized_key:\n    user: '&quot;{{ item.name }}&quot;'\n    key: '&quot;{{ item.ssh_key }}&quot;'\n</code></pre>\n<p>The task above will take the specified <code>key</code> and adds it to the specified <code>user</code>’s <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file, just as you would either by hand, or using <code>ssh-copy-id</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theaptmodule\">The Apt module</h2>\n<p>We need a new <code>vars</code> block for the packages to be installed.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">vars:\n  packages:\n    - vim\n    - wget\n    - curl\n    - htop\n\ntasks:\n  - name: Ensure a list of packages installed\n    apt:\n      name: '&quot;{{ packages }}&quot;'\n      state: present\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>apt</code> module manages apt packages (such as for Debian/Ubuntu). The <code>name</code> field can take a list of packages to be installed. Here, we define a variable to store the list of desired packages to keep the task cleaner, and this also gives us the ability to overwrite the package list with command-line arguments if we feel necessary when we apply the playbook, without editing the actual playbook.</p>\n<p>The <code>state</code> field is set to be present, meaning that Ansible should install the package if it’s missing, or skip it, if it’s already present. In other words, it ensures that the package is present.  It could be also set to <code>absent</code> (ensure that it’s not there), <code>latest</code> (ensure that it’s there and it’s the latest version, <code>build-deps</code> (ensure that it’s build dependencies are present), or <code>fixed</code> (attempt to correct a system with broken dependencies in place).</p>\n<h2 id=\"letsrunouransibleplaybook\">Let’s run our Ansible Playbook</h2>\n<p>Just to reiterate, here is the whole playbook together:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">- hosts: all\n  become: 'yes'\n  vars:\n    user:\n      - name: &quot;pi&quot;\n        password: &quot;secret&quot;\n        ssh_key: &quot;ssh-rsa …&quot;\n    packages:\n      - vim\n      - wget\n      - curl\n      - htop\n  tasks:\n    - name: Change password for default user\n      user:\n        name: '&quot;{{ item.name }}&quot;'\n        password: '&quot;{{ item.password | password_hash('sha512') }}&quot;'\n        state: present\n      loop:\n        - '&quot;{{ user }}&quot;'\n    - name: Add SSH public key\n      authorized_key:\n        user: '&quot;{{ item.name }}&quot;'\n        key: '&quot;{{ item.ssh_key }}&quot;'\n      loop:\n        - '&quot;{{ user }}&quot;'\n    - name: Ensure a list of packages installed\n      apt:\n        name: '&quot;{{ packages }}&quot;'\n        state: present\n    - name: All done!\n      debug:\n        msg: Packages have been successfully installed\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we’re ready to run the playbook:</p>\n<pre><code>ansible-playbook pi-setup.yml\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or we can run it with overwriting the config file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False\n\n$ ansible-playbook - i “192.168.0.74, 192.168.0.75” ansible_user=john  ansible_ssh_pass=johnspassword” -e  ‘{“user”: [{ “name”: “pi”, “password”: “raspberry”, “state”: “present” }] }’ -e '{&quot;packages&quot;:[&quot;curl&quot;,&quot;wget&quot;]}' pi-setup.yml\n</code></pre>\n<p>The command-line flags used in the snippet above are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>-i (inventory): specifies the inventory. It can either be a comma-separated list as above, or an inventory file.</li>\n<li>-e (or --extra-vars): variables can be added or overridden through this flag. In our case we are overwriting the configuration laid out in our <code>hosts</code> file (<code>ansible_user</code>, <code>ansible_ssh_pass</code>) and the variables <code>user</code> and <code>packages</code> that we have previously set up in our playbook.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whattouseansiblefor\">What to use Ansible for</h2>\n<p>Of course, Ansible is not used solely for setting up home-made servers.</p>\n<p>Ansible is used to manage VM fleets in bulk, making sure that each newly created VM has the same configuration as the others. It also makes it easy to change the configuration of the whole fleet together by applying a change to just one playbook.</p>\n<p>But Ansible can be used for a plethora of other tasks as well. If you have just a single server running in a cloud provider, you can define its configuration in a way that others can read and use easily. You can also define maintenance playbooks as well, such as creating new users and adding the SSH key of new employees to the server, so they can log into the machine as well.</p>\n<p>Or you can use <a href=\"https://github.com/ansible/awx\">AWX</a> or <a href=\"https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/tower.html\">Ansible Tower</a> to create a GUI based Linux server management system that provides a similar experience to what Windows Servers provide.</p>\n<p><em>Stay tuned and subscribe to our newsletter!

Since it's a re-release, we fully updated it with new code examples, as there are a lot of new Node.js features since the original release which you can take advantage of.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"whatareasyncfunctionsinnode\">What are async functions in Node?</h2>\n<p>Async functions are available natively in Node and are denoted by the <code>async</code> keyword in their declaration. They always return a promise, even if you don’t explicitly write them to do so. Also, the <code>await</code> keyword is only available inside async functions at the moment - it cannot be used in the global scope.</p>\n<p>In an async function, you can await any <code>Promise</code> or catch its rejection cause.</p>\n<p>So if you had some logic implemented with promises:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">function handler (req, res) {\n  return request('https://user-handler-service')\n    .catch((err) =&gt; {\n      logger.error('Http error', err);\n      error.logged = true;\n      throw err;\n    })\n    .then((response) =&gt; Mongo.findOne({ user: response.body.user }))\n    .catch((err) =&gt; {\n      !error.logged &amp;&amp; logger.error('Mongo error', err);\n      error.logged = true;\n      throw err;\n    })\n    .then((document) =&gt; executeLogic(req, res, document))\n    .catch((err) =&gt; {\n      !error.logged &amp;&amp; console.error(err);\n      res.status(500).send();\n    });\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can make it look like synchronous code using <code>async/await</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">async function handler (req, res) {\n  let response;\n  try {\n    response = await request('https://user-handler-service')  ;\n  } catch (err) {\n    logger.error('Http error', err);\n    return res.status(500).send();\n  }\n\n  let document;\n  try {\n    document = await Mongo.findOne({ user: response.body.user });\n  } catch (err) {\n    logger.error('Mongo error', err);\n    return res.status(500).send();\n  }\n\n  executeLogic(document, req, res);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Currently in Node  you get a warning about unhandled promise rejections, so you don’t necessarily need to bother with creating a listener. However, it is recommended to crash your app in this case as when you don’t handle an error, your app is in an unknown state. This can be done either by using the <code>--unhandled-rejections=strict</code> CLI flag, or by implementing something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">process.on('unhandledRejection', (err) =&gt; { \n  console.error(err);\n  process.exit(1);\n})\n</code></pre>\n<p>Automatic process exit will be added in a future Node release - preparing your code ahead of time for this is not a lot of effort, but will mean that you don’t have to worry about it when you next wish to update versions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"patternswithasyncfunctions\">Patterns with async functions</h2>\n<p>There are quite a couple of use cases when the ability to handle asynchronous operations as if they were synchronous comes very handy, as solving them with Promises or callbacks requires the use of complex patterns.</p>\n<p>Since node@10.0.0, there is support for async iterators and the related for-await-of loop. These come in handy when the actual values we iterate over, and the end state of the iteration, are not known by the time the iterator method returns - mostly when working with streams. Aside from streams, there are not a lot of constructs that have the async iterator implemented natively, so we’ll cover them in another post.</p>\n<h3 id=\"retrywithexponentialbackoff\">Retry with exponential backoff</h3>\n<p>Implementing retry logic was pretty clumsy with Promises:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">function request(url) {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    setTimeout(() =&gt; {\n      reject(`Network error when trying to reach ${url}`);\n    }, 500);\n  });\n}\n\nfunction requestWithRetry(url, retryCount, currentTries = 1) {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    if (currentTries &lt;= retryCount) {\n      const timeout = (Math.pow(2, currentTries) - 1) * 100;\n      request(url)\n        .then(resolve)\n        .catch((error) =&gt; {\n          setTimeout(() =&gt; {\n            console.log('Error: ', error);\n            console.log(`Waiting ${timeout} ms`);\n            requestWithRetry(url, retryCount, currentTries + 1);\n          }, timeout);\n        });\n    } else {\n      console.log('No retries left, giving up.');\n      reject('No retries left, giving up.');\n    }\n  });\n}\n\nrequestWithRetry('http://localhost:3000')\n  .then((res) =&gt; {\n    console.log(res)\n  })\n  .catch(err =&gt; {\n    console.error(err)\n  });\n</code></pre>\n<p>This would get the job done, but we can rewrite it with <code>async/await</code> and make it a lot more simple.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">function wait (timeout) {\n  return new Promise((resolve) =&gt; {\n    setTimeout(() =&gt; {\n      resolve()\n    }, timeout);\n  });\n}\n\nasync function requestWithRetry (url) {\n  const MAX_RETRIES = 10;\n  for (let i = 0; i &lt;= MAX_RETRIES; i++) {\n    try {\n      return await request(url);\n    } catch (err) {\n      const timeout = Math.pow(2, i);\n      console.log('Waiting', timeout, 'ms');\n      await wait(timeout);\n      console.log('Retrying', err.message, i);\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>A lot more pleasing to the eye isn't it?</p>\n<h3 id=\"intermediatevalues\">Intermediate values</h3>\n<p>Not as hideous as the previous example, but if you have a case where 3 asynchronous functions depend on each other the following way, then you have to choose from several ugly solutions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>functionA</code> returns a Promise, then <code>functionB</code> needs that value and <code>functionC</code> needs the resolved value of both <code>functionA</code>'s and <code>functionB</code>'s Promise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"solution1thethenchristmastree\">Solution 1: The <code>.then</code> Christmas tree</h4>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">function executeAsyncTask () {\n  return functionA()\n    .then((valueA) =&gt; {\n      return functionB(valueA)\n        .then((valueB) =&gt; {          \n          return functionC(valueA, valueB)\n        })\n    })\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>With this solution, we get <code>valueA</code> from the surrounding closure of the 3rd <code>then</code> and <code>valueB</code> as the value the previous Promise resolves to. We cannot flatten out the Christmas tree as we would lose the closure and <code>valueA</code> would be unavailable for <code>functionC</code>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"solution2movingtoahigherscope\">Solution 2: Moving to a higher scope</h4>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">function executeAsyncTask () {\n  let valueA\n  return functionA()\n    .then((v) =&gt; {\n      valueA = v\n      return functionB(valueA)\n    })\n    .then((valueB) =&gt; {\n      return functionC(valueA, valueB)\n    })\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the Christmas tree, we used a higher scope to make <code>valueA</code> available as well. This case works similarly, but now we created the variable <code>valueA</code> outside the scope of the <code>.then</code>-s, so we can assign the value of the first resolved Promise to it.</p>\n<p>This one definitely works, flattens the <code>.then</code> chain and is semantically correct. However, it also opens up ways for new bugs in case the variable name <code>valueA</code> is used elsewhere in the function. We also need to use two names — <code>valueA</code> and <code>v</code> — for the same value.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Are you looking for help with enterprise-grade Node.js Development?<br>\n<a href=\"https://risingstack.com/nodejs-development-consulting-services\">Hire the Node developers of RisingStack</a>!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"solution3theunnecessaryarray\">Solution 3: The unnecessary array</h4>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">function executeAsyncTask () {\n  return functionA()\n    .then(valueA =&gt; {\n      return Promise.all([valueA, functionB(valueA)])\n    })\n    .then(([valueA, valueB]) =&gt; {\n      return functionC(valueA, valueB)\n    })\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>There is no other reason for <code>valueA</code> to be passed on in an array together with the Promise <code>functionB</code> then to be able to flatten the tree. They might be of completely different types, so there is a high probability of them not belonging to an array at all.</p>\n<h4 id=\"solution4writeahelperfunction\">Solution 4: Write a helper function</h4>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const converge = (...promises) =&gt; (...args) =&gt; {\n  let [head, ...tail] = promises\n  if (tail.length) {\n    return head(...args)\n      .then((value) =&gt; converge(...tail)(...args.concat([value])))\n  } else {\n    return head(...args)\n  }\n}\n\nfunctionA(2)\n  .then((valueA) =&gt; converge(functionB, functionC)(valueA))\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can, of course, write a helper function to hide away the context juggling, but it is quite difficult to read, and may not be straightforward to understand for those who are not well versed in functional magic.</p>\n<h4 id=\"byusingasyncawaitourproblemsaremagicallygone\">By using <code>async/await</code> our problems are magically gone:</h4>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">async function executeAsyncTask () {\n  const valueA = await functionA();\n  const valueB = await functionB(valueA);\n  return function3(valueA, valueB);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"multipleparallelrequestswithasyncawait\">Multiple parallel requests with async/await</h3>\n<p>This is similar to the previous one. In case you want to execute several asynchronous tasks at once and then use their values at different places, you can do it easily with <code>async/await</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">async function executeParallelAsyncTasks () {\n  const [ valueA, valueB, valueC ] = await Promise.all([ functionA(), functionB(), functionC() ]);\n  doSomethingWith(valueA);\n  doSomethingElseWith(valueB);\n  doAnotherThingWith(valueC);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>As we've seen in the previous example, we would either need to move these values into a higher scope or create a non-semantic array to pass these values on.</p>\n<h3 id=\"arrayiterationmethods\">Array iteration methods</h3>\n<p>You can use <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code> and <code>reduce</code> with async functions, although they behave pretty unintuitively. Try guessing what the following scripts will print to the console:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>map</em></li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">function asyncThing (value) {\n  return new Promise((resolve) =&gt; {\n    setTimeout(() =&gt; resolve(value), 100);\n  });\n}\n\nasync function main () {\n  return [1,2,3,4].map(async (value) =&gt; {\n    const v = await asyncThing(value);\n    return v * 2;\n  });\n}\n\nmain()\n  .then(v =&gt; console.log(v))\n  .catch(err =&gt; console.error(err));\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><em>filter</em></li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">function asyncThing (value) {\n  return new Promise((resolve) =&gt; {\n    setTimeout(() =&gt; resolve(value), 100);\n  });\n}\n\nasync function main () {\n  return [1,2,3,4].filter(async (value) =&gt; {\n    const v = await asyncThing(value);\n    return v % 2 === 0;\n  });\n}\n\nmain()\n  .then(v =&gt; console.log(v))\n  .catch(err =&gt; console.error(err));\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><em>reduce</em></li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">\nfunction asyncThing (value) {\n  return new Promise((resolve) =&gt; {\n    setTimeout(() =&gt; resolve(value), 100);\n  });\n}\n\nasync function main () {\n  return [1,2,3,4].reduce(async (acc, value) =&gt; {\n    return await acc + await asyncThing(value);\n  }, Promise.resolve(0));\n}\n\nmain()\n  .then(v =&gt; console.log(v))\n  .catch(err =&gt; console.error(err));\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>[ Promise { &lt;pending&gt; }, Promise { &lt;pending&gt; }, Promise { &lt;pending&gt; }, Promise { &lt;pending&gt; } ]</code></li>\n<li><code>[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]</code></li>\n<li><code>10</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you log the returned values of the iteratee with <strong><code>map</code></strong> you will see the array we expect: <code>[ 2, 4, 6, 8 ]</code>. The only problem is that each value is wrapped in a Promise by the <code>AsyncFunction</code>.</p>\n<p>So if you want to get your values, you'll need to unwrap them by passing the returned array to a <code>Promise.all</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">main()\n  .then(v =&gt; Promise.all(v))\n  .then(v =&gt; console.log(v))\n  .catch(err =&gt; console.error(err));\n</code></pre>\n<p>Originally, you would first wait for all your promises to resolve and then map over the values:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">function main () {\n  return Promise.all([1,2,3,4].map((value) =&gt; asyncThing(value)));\n}\n\nmain()\n  .then(values =&gt; values.map((value) =&gt; value * 2))\n  .then(v =&gt; console.log(v))\n  .catch(err =&gt; console.error(err));\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>This seems a bit more simple, doesn’t it?</strong></p>\n<p>The <code>async/await</code> version can still be useful if you have some long running synchronous logic in your iteratee and another long-running async task.</p>\n<p>This way you can start calculating as soon as you have the first value - you don't have to wait for all the Promises to be resolved to run your computations. Even though the results will still be wrapped in Promises, those are resolved a lot faster then if you did it the sequential way.</p>\n<p><strong>What about <code>filter</code>? Something is clearly wrong...</strong></p>\n<p>Well, you guessed it: even though the returned values are <code>[ false, true, false, true ]</code>, they will be wrapped in promises, which are truthy, so you'll get back all the values from the original array. Unfortunately, all you can do to fix this is to resolve all the values and then filter them.</p>\n<p><strong>Reducing</strong> is pretty straightforward. Bear in mind though that you need to wrap the initial value into <code>Promise.resolve</code>, as the returned accumulator will be wrapped as well and has to be <code>await</code>-ed.</p>\n<p>.. As it is pretty clearly intended to be used for imperative code styles.</p>\n<p>To make your <code>.then</code> chains more &quot;pure&quot; looking, you can use Ramda's <a href=\"http://ramdajs.com/0.17/docs/#pipeP\"><code>pipeP</code></a> and <a href=\"http://ramdajs.com/0.17/docs/#composeP\"><code>composeP</code></a> functions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rewritingcallbackbasednodejsapplications\">Rewriting callback-based Node.js applications</h2>\n<p>Async functions return a <code>Promise</code> by default, so you can rewrite any callback based function to use Promises, then <code>await</code> their resolution. You can use the <a href=\"http://2ality.com/2017/05/util-promisify.html\"><code>util.promisify</code></a> function in Node.js to turn callback-based functions to return a Promise-based ones.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rewritingpromisebasedapplications\">Rewriting Promise-based applications</h2>\n<p>Simple <code>.then</code> chains can be upgraded in a pretty straightforward way, so you can move to using <code>async/await</code> right away.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">function asyncTask () {\n  return functionA()\n    .then((valueA) =&gt; functionB(valueA))\n    .then((valueB) =&gt; functionC(valueB))\n    .then((valueC) =&gt; functionD(valueC))\n    .catch((err) =&gt; logger.error(err))\n}\n \n</code></pre>\n<p>will turn into</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">async function asyncTask () {\n  try {\n    const valueA = await functionA();\n    const valueB = await functionB(valueA);\n    const valueC = await functionC(valueB);\n    return await functionD(valueC);\n  } catch (err) {\n    logger.error(err);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"rewritingnodejsappswithasyncawait\">Rewriting Node.js apps with async/await</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>If you liked the good old concepts of <code>if-else</code> conditionals and <code>for/while</code> loops,</li>\n<li>if you believe that a <code>try-catch</code> block is the way errors are meant to be handled,</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>you will have a great time rewriting your services using <code>async/await</code>.</strong></p>\n<p>As we have seen, it can make several patterns a lot easier to code and read, so it is definitely more suitable in several cases than <code>Promise.then()</code> chains. However, if you are caught up in the functional programming craze of the past years, you might wanna pass on this language feature.</p>\n<p><strong>Are you already using <code>async/await</code> in production, or you plan on never touching it?</strong> Let's discuss it in the comments below.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Are you looking for help with enterprise-grade Node.js Development?<br>\n<a href=\"https://risingstack.com/nodejs-development-consulting-services\">Hire the Node developers of RisingStack</a>!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>This article was originally written by Tamas Kadlecsik and was released on 2017 July 5.

Node.js</h2>\n<p>Previously we have gathered a strong knowledge about <a href=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/node-hero-async-programming-in-node-js/\">asynchronous programming in JavaScript</a> and understood how the <a href=\"https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-at-scale-understanding-node-js-event-loop/\">Node.js event loop</a> works.</p>\n<p>If you have not read these articles, I highly recommend them as introductions!</p>\n<h2 id=\"theproblemwithnodejsasync\">The Problem with Node.js Async</h2>\n<p>Node.js itself is single-threaded, but some tasks can run in parallel thanks to its asynchronous nature.</p>\n<p><strong>But what does running in parallel mean in practice?</strong></p>\n<p>Since we program a single-threaded VM, it is essential that we <strong>do not block execution by waiting for I/O, but handle operations concurrently</strong> with the help of Node.js's event-driven APIs.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at some fundamental patterns, and learn how we can write resource-efficient, non-blocking code, with the built-in solutions of Node.js.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theclassicalapproachcallbacks\">The Classical Approach - Callbacks</h2>\n<p>Let's take a look at these simple async operations. They do nothing special, just fire a timer and call a function once the timer finished.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function fastFunction (done) {\n  setTimeout(function () {\n    done()\n  }, 100)\n}\n\nfunction slowFunction (done) {\n  setTimeout(function () {\n    done()\n  }, 300)\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Seems easy, right?</strong></p>\n<p>Our higher-order functions can be executed sequentially or in parallel with the basic &quot;pattern&quot; by nesting callbacks - <strong>but using this method can lead to an untameable callback-hell.</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function runSequentially (callback) {\n  fastFunction((err, data) =&gt; {\n    if (err) return callback(err)\n    console.log(data)   // results of a\n  \n    slowFunction((err, data) =&gt; {\n      if (err) return callback(err)\n      console.log(data) // results of b\n  \n      // here you can continue running more tasks\n    })\n  })\n}\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"click-to-tweet\">\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Never%20use%20the%20nested%20callback%20approach%20for%20handling%20asynchronous%20%23nodejs%20operations!%22%20via%20%40RisingStack;url=https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-async-best-practices-avoiding-callback-hell-node-js-at-scale/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        Never use the nested callback approach for handling asynchronous #nodejs operations!\" via @RisingStack\n    </a>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"avoidingcallbackhellwithcontrolflowmanagers\">Avoiding Callback Hell with Control Flow Managers</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To become an efficient Node.js developer, you have to avoid the constantly growing indentation level, produce clean and readable code and be able to handle complex flows.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let me show you some of the tools we can use to organize our code in a nice and maintainable way!</p>\n<h2 id=\"1usingpromises\">#1: Using Promises</h2>\n<p>There have been native promises in javascript since 2014, receiving an important boost in performance in Node.js 8. We will make use of them in our functions to make them non-blocking - without the traditional callbacks. The following example will call the modified version of both our previous functions in such a manner:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function fastFunction () {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    setTimeout(function () {\n      console.log('Fast function done')\n      resolve()\n    }, 100)\n  })\n}\n\nfunction slowFunction () {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    setTimeout(function () {\n      console.log('Slow function done')\n      resolve()\n    }, 300)\n  })\n}\n\nfunction asyncRunner () {\n    return Promise.all([slowFunction(), fastFunction()])\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Please note that <code>Promise.all</code> will fail as soon as any of the promises inside it fails.</strong></p>\n<p>The previous functions have been modified slightly to return promises. Our new function, asyncRunner, will also return a promise, that will resolve when all the contained functions resolve, and this also means that wherever we call our asyncRunner, we'll be able to use the .then and .catch methods to deal with the possible outcomes:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">asyncRunner()\n  .then(([ slowResult, fastResult ]) =&gt; {\n    console.log('All operations resolved successfully')\n  })\n  .catch((error) =&gt; {\n    console.error('There has been an error:', error)\n  })\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since node@12.9.0, there is a method called <code>promise.allSettled</code>, that we can use to get the result of all the passed in promises regardless of rejections. Much like Promise.all, this function expects an array of promises, and returns an array of objects  that has a status of “fulfilled” or “rejected”, and either the resolved value or the error that occurred.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function failingFunction() {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    reject(new Error('This operation will surely fail!'))\n  })\n}\n\nfunction asyncMixedRunner () {\n    return Promise.allSettled([slowFunction(), failingFunction()])\n}\n\nasyncMixedRunner()\n    .then(([slowResult, failedResult]) =&gt; {\n        console.log(slowResult, failedResult)\n    })\n</code></pre>\n<p>In previous node versions, where <code>.allSettled</code> is not available, we can implement our own version in just a few lines:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function homebrewAllSettled(promises) {\n  return Promise.all(promises.map((promise) =&gt; {\n    return promise\n      .then((value) =&gt; {\n        return { status: 'fulfilled', value }\n      })\n      .catch((error) =&gt; {\n        return { status: 'rejected', error }\n      })\n  }))\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"serialtaskexecution\">Serial task execution</h3>\n<p>To make sure your tasks run in a specific order - maybe successive functions need the return value of previous ones, or depend on the run of previous functions less directly - which is basically the same as <a href=\"https://lodash.com/docs/#flow\"><code>_.flow</code></a> for functions that return a Promise. As long as it's missing from everyone's favorite utility library, you can easily create a chain from an array of your async functions:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function serial(asyncFunctions) {\n    return asyncFunctions.reduce(function(functionChain, nextFunction) {\n        return functionChain.then(\n            (previousResult) =&gt; nextFunction(previousResult)\n        );\n    }, Promise.resolve());\n}\n\nserial([parameterValidation, dbQuery, serviceCall ])\n   .then((result) =&gt; console.log(`Operation result: ${result}`))\n   .catch((error) =&gt; console.log(`There has been an error: ${error}`))\n</code></pre>\n<p>In case of a failure, this will skip all the remaining promises, and go straight to the error handling branch. You can tweak it some more in case you need the result of all of the promises regardless if they resolved or rejected.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function serial(asyncFunctions) {\n    return asyncFunctions.map(function(functionChain, nextFunction) {\n        return functionChain\n            .then((previousResult) =&gt; nextFunction(previousResult))\n            .then(result =&gt; ({ status: 'fulfilled', result }))\n            .catch(error =&gt; ({ status: 'rejected', error }));\n    }, Promise.resolve());\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"convertingcallbackfunctionstopromises\">Converting callback functions to promises</h3>\n<p>Node also provides a handy utility function called &quot;promisify&quot;, that you can use to convert any old function expecting a callback that you just have to use into one that returns a promise. All you need to do is import it in your project:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const promisify = require('util').promisify;\nfunction slowCallbackFunction (done) {\n  setTimeout(function () {\n    done()\n  }, 300)\n}\nconst slowPromise = promisify(slowCallbackFunction);\n\nslowPromise()\n  .then(() =&gt; {\n    console.log('Slow function resolved')\n  })\n  .catch((error) =&gt; {\n    console.error('There has been an error:', error)\n  })\n</code></pre>\n<p>It's actually not that hard to implement a promisify function of our own, to learn more about how it works. We can even handle additional arguments that our wrapped functions might need!</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function homebrewPromisify(originalFunction, originalArgs = []) {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    originalFunction(...originalArgs, (error, result) =&gt; {\n      if (error) return reject(error)\n      return resolve(result)\n    })\n  })\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We just wrap the original callback-based function in a promise, and then reject or resolve based on  the result of the operation.</p>\n<p>Easy as that!</p>\n<p>For better support of callback based code - legacy code, ~50% of the npm modules - Node also includes a <code>callbackify</code> function, essentially the opposite of <code>promisify</code>, which takes an async function that returns a promise, and returns a function that expects a callback as its single argument.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const callbackify = require('util').callbackify\nconst callbackSlow = callbackify(slowFunction)\n\ncallbackSlow((error, result) =&gt; {\n  if (error) return console.log('Callback function received an error')\n  return console.log('Callback resolved without errors')\n})\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"2meetasyncakahowtowriteasynccodein2020\">#2: Meet Async - aka how to write async code in 2020</h2>\n<p>We can use another javascript feature since node@7.6 to achieve the same thing: the async and await keywords. They allow you to structure your code in a way that is almost synchronous looking, saving us the <code>.then</code> chaining as well as callbacks:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const promisify = require('util').promisify;\n\nasync function asyncRunner () {\n    try {\n      const slowResult = await promisify(slowFunction)()\n      const fastResult = await promisify(fastFunction)()\n      console.log('all done')\n      return [\n        slowResult,\n        fastResult\n      ]\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error(error)\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is the same async runner we've created before, but it does not require us to wrap our code in <code>.then</code> calls to gain access to the results. For handling errors, we have the option to use try &amp; catch blocks, as presented above, or use the same <code>.catch</code> calls that we've seen previously with promises. This is possible because async-await is an abstraction on top of promises - async functions always return a promise, even if you don't explicitly declare them to do so.</p>\n<p><strong>The await keyword can only be used inside functions that have the async tag. This also means that we cannot currently utilize it in the global scope.</strong></p>\n<p>Since Node 10, we also have access to the <code>promise.finally</code> method, which allows us to run code regardless of whether the promise resolve or rejected. It can be used to run tasks that we had to call in both the <code>.then</code> and <code>.catch</code> paths previously, saving us some code duplication.</p>\n<h2 id=\"usingallofthisinpractice\">Using all of this in Practice</h2>\n<p><strong>As we have just learned several tools and tricks to handle async, it is time to do some practice with fundamental control flows to make our code more efficient and clean.</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s take an example and write a route <code>handler</code> for our web app, where the request can be resolved after 3 steps: <code>validateParams</code>, <code>dbQuery</code> and <code>serviceCall</code>.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to write them without any helper, you'd most probably end up with something like this. Not so nice, right?</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// validateParams, dbQuery, serviceCall are higher-order functions\n// DONT\nfunction handler (done) {\n  validateParams((err) =&gt; {\n    if (err) return done(err)\n    dbQuery((err, dbResults) =&gt; {\n      if (err) return done(err)\n      serviceCall((err, serviceResults) =&gt; {\n        done(err, { dbResults, serviceResults })\n      })\n    })\n  })\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Instead of the callback-hell, we can use promises to refactor our code, as we have already learned:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// validateParams, dbQuery, serviceCall are higher-order functions\nfunction handler () {\n  return validateParams()\n    .then(dbQuery)\n    .then(serviceCall)\n    .then((result) =&gt; {\n      console.log(result)\n      return result\n    })\n    .catch(console.log.bind(console))\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Let's take it a step further! Rewrite it to use the async and await keywords:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// validateParams, dbQuery, serviceCall are thunks\nasync function handler () {\n  try {\n    await validateParams()\n    const dbResults = await dbQuery()\n    const serviceResults = await serviceCall()\n    return { dbResults, serviceResults }\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.log(error)\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>It feels like a &quot;synchronous&quot; code but still doing async operations one after each other.</p>\n<p>Essentially, a new callback is injected into the functions, and this is how async knows when a function is finished.</p>\n<h2 id=\"takeawayrulesfornodejsasync\">Takeaway rules for Node.js &amp; Async</h2>\n<p>Fortunately, Node.js eliminates the complexities of writing thread-safe code. <strong>You just have to stick to these rules to keep things smooth:</strong></p>\n<p>As a rule of thumb, prefer async, because using a non-blocking approach gives superior performance over the synchronous scenario, and the async - await keywords gives you more flexibility in structuring your code. Luckily, most libraries now have promise based APIs, so compatibility is rarely an issue, and can be solved with util.promisify should the need arise.</p>\n<p><strong>If you have any questions or suggestions for the article, please let me know in the comments!</strong></p>\n<p>In case you're looking for help with <a href=\"https://risingstack.com/nodejs-development-consulting-services\">Node.js consulting or development</a>, feel free to reach out to us!

I assume you have an AWS account.</p>\n<p>Create an <code>s3_bucket.tf</code> file in your project and insert the content below to it:</p>\n<pre><code>resource &quot;aws_s3_bucket&quot; &quot;my-static-site&quot; {\n  bucket = &quot;my-static-site&quot;\n  acl    = &quot;public-read&quot;\n  policy = &lt;&lt;POLICY\n{\n  &quot;Version&quot;:&quot;2012-10-17&quot;,\n  &quot;Statement&quot;:[\n    {\n      &quot;Sid&quot;:&quot;PublicRead&quot;,\n      &quot;Effect&quot;:&quot;Allow&quot;,\n      &quot;Principal&quot;: &quot;*&quot;,\n      &quot;Action&quot;:[&quot;s3:GetObject&quot;],\n      &quot;Resource&quot;:[&quot;arn:aws:s3:::my-static-site/*&quot;]\n    }\n  ]\n}\nPOLICY\n\n  website {\n    index_document = &quot;index.html&quot;\n    error_document = &quot;index.html&quot;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, folllow these steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>execute <code>terraform init</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>insert the following code snippet</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=&quot;anaccesskey&quot;\nexport AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=&quot;asecretkey&quot;\nexport AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=&quot;us-east-1&quot;\nterraform plan\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>execute <code>terraform apply</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This will create a public readable AWS S3 bucket, which will host the static site.</p>\n<p>Now we have to take care of building the static site on our own: we need a CI tool.</p>\n<h3 id=\"settingupcircleciforcontinuousintegration\">Setting up CircleCI for continuous integration</h3>\n<p>At RisingStack, we’re usually using CircleCI for these kinds of tasks.

It appears not only in forms, but also in some other classes, f.i. in a <em>TDataModule</em>. It was introduced in either Delphi 4 or Delphi 5 &#8211; (I can only say it was absent in Delphi 3, but present in Delphi 5).</p>\n<p>Basically <em>OldCreateOrder</em> controls when the <em>OnCreate</em> and <em>OnDestroy</em> events are called. In case of a <em>TCustomForm</em> descendant, with <em>OldCreateOrder = True</em> the <em>OnCreate</em> is called inside <em>TCustomForm.Create</em> after the DFM is loaded, while with <em>False</em> the <em>OnCreate</em> is called after all inherited constructors are finished (i.e. in <em>TCustomForm.AfterConstruction</em>).</p>\n<p>This has consequences for the way you code. Let me show you the difference with a simple example of a VCL form with a memo and a button. The memo contains some text entered at design time, which is saved in a <em>TStringList</em> instance during <em>FormCreate</em>. The <em>TStringList</em> is create in the <em>constructor</em> and destroyed in the <em>destructor</em>.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">type\r\n  TMainForm = class(TForm)\r\n    edtText: TMemo;\r\n    btnReset: TButton;\r\n    procedure FormDestroy(Sender: TObject);\r\n    procedure btnResetClick(Sender: TObject);\r\n    procedure FormCreate(Sender: TObject);\r\n  private\r\n    FDesignText: TStrings;\r\n  public\r\n    constructor Create(AOwner: TComponent); override;\r\n    destructor Destroy; override;\r\n  end;</pre><p>A click on the button restores the text to the saved content.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">constructor TMainForm.Create(AOwner: TComponent);\r\nbegin\r\n  inherited;\r\n  FDesignText := TStringList.Create;\r\nend;\r\n\r\nprocedure TMainForm.FormCreate(Sender: TObject);\r\nbegin\r\n  FDesignText.Assign(edtText.Lines);\r\nend;\r\n\r\ndestructor TMainForm.Destroy;\r\nbegin\r\n  FDesignText.Free;\r\n  FDesignText := nil;\r\n  inherited Destroy;\r\nend;\r\n\r\nprocedure TMainForm.FormDestroy(Sender: TObject);\r\nbegin\r\n  FDesignText.Clear;\r\nend;\r\n\r\nprocedure TMainForm.btnResetClick(Sender: TObject);\r\nbegin\r\n  edtText.Lines := FDesignText;\r\nend;</pre><p>When you run this project with <em>OldCreateOrder = False</em> (the default), everything is working as expected (unless you are doing this with a really, really old Delphi version).</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s switch <em>OldCreateOrder</em> to <i>True </i>and try again: It will crash with a nil pointer reference in <em>FormCreate</em>.</p>\n<p>If we recall what I have written above</p>\n<blockquote><p>with <em>OldCreateOrder = True</em> the <em>OnCreate</em> is called inside <em>TCustomForm.Create</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>this was to be expected.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">constructor TMainForm.Create(AOwner: TComponent);\r\nbegin\r\n  inherited; // &lt;== here we call FormCreate\r\n  FDesignText := TStringList.Create;\r\nend;</pre><p>The typical workaround in these old days, when <em>OldCreateOrder</em> was the only and standard behavior, was to move the <em>TStringList</em> creation before the <em>inherited</em> call. Luckily this approach works even when <em>OldCreateOrder</em> is <em>False</em>.</p>\n<p>Of course, we could as well move the creation on the <em>FormCreate</em> event, but personally I dislike this approach &#8211; be it because it just doesn&#8217;t look clean to me.</p>\n<p>Looking at the other side &#8211; <em>Destroy</em> and <em>FormDestroy</em> &#8211; things are quite similar, albeit the other way round. With <em>OldCreateOrder = True</em>, the <em>FormDestroy</em> is called inside the <em>inherited</em> call of <em>Destroy</em>, while with <em>OldCreateOrder = False</em> it is called before any destructor is executed.</p>\n<p>So, whenever you see a pattern in creating instances before calling a constructors <em>inherited</em> and freeing after that in a destructor, you now know where this habit originates.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/2021/02/18/oldcreateorder-er-what/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>2</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Tweaking DFM Loading (update)</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/2021/01/30/tweaking-dfm-loading-update/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Uwe Raabe]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 30 Jan 2021 11:24:08 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Delphi]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Programming]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/?p=1057</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[In my previous article Tweaking DFM Loading I explained ways to overcome the name problem with several instances of a data module.

I can&#8217;t count the occasions where I have seen a form being decorated with some data controls connected to a <em>TDatasource</em>, which itself is connected to a <em>TDataset</em> descendant (see the <a href=\"http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/Sydney/en/Database_Architecture\">docwiki</a>).<span id=\"more-1030\"></span></p>\n<p>Often these controls are placed on the form, but that approach is usually not recommended. While the data controls <strong>must</strong> reside on the form and the data source(s) <strong>should</strong> better be on the form, too (I will explain later why), the <em>TDataSet</em> descendants are better placed on a separate data module. This allows the separation of the data logic from the UI and (hopefully) encourages reuse.</p>\n<p>This simple example has two data modules and two forms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>The data module <em>TDbConnectDM</em> contains the connection component and the wait cursor component required by FireDAC.</li>\n<li>The second data module <em>TMainDM</em> has the dataset, a <em>TFDQuery</em> with its static fields, and an action with its action list. The query  is connected to the <em>TFDConnection</em> from <em>DBConnectDM</em>.</li>\n<li>The form <em>TMainForm</em> introduces a data source connected to the query from <em>MainDM</em> and a <em>TDBGrid</em> and <em>TDBNavigator</em> connected to the data source. A simple <em>TButton</em> to open an instance of the second form (<em>TEditForm</em>) completes the controls on this form.</li>\n<li>The remaining form <em>TEditForm</em> also has a data source connected to the query from <em>MainDM</em>, a couple of <em>TDBEdit</em> controls connected to the data source and configured for the different fields of the query and a <em>TButton</em> connected to the action of <em>MainDM</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The real magic happens during runtime where all these connections are re-established when the forms and data modules are instantiated.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 840px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->\n<video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-1030-1\" width=\"840\" height=\"474\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/video1.mp4?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/video1.mp4\">https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/video1.mp4</a></video></div>\n<p>The connections between all these components are responsible for the lack of actual code to write. The only code in all data modules and forms is this:</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">procedure TMainDM.Action1Execute(Sender: TObject);\r\nbegin\r\n  tblData.Post;\r\nend;\r\n\r\nprocedure TMainDM.Action1Update(Sender: TObject);\r\nbegin\r\n  Action1.Caption := 'Save ' + tblDataEMP_NO.AsString;\r\nend;</pre><p></p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">procedure TMainForm.btnEditClick(Sender: TObject);\r\nvar\r\n  instance: TEditForm;\r\nbegin\r\n  instance := TEditForm.Create(nil);\r\n  try\r\n    instance.ShowModal;\r\n  finally\r\n    instance.Free;\r\n  end;\r\nend;</pre><p>Not sure about you, but selecting a record, clicking <em>Edit Record</em>, closing the dialog before selecting the next record seems not very comfortable to me. Let&#8217;s change from a modal Edit window to a non-modal one working always on the current record.</p>\n<p>Turns out that is even a bit simpler: We add the <em>Edit Form</em> to the auto-create forms of the application and reduce the button click event to simply show that form:</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">procedure TMainForm.btnEditClick(Sender: TObject);\r\nbegin\r\n  EditForm.Show;\r\nend;</pre><p><div style=\"width: 840px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-1030-2\" width=\"840\" height=\"374\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/video2.mp4?_=2\" /><a href=\"https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/video2.mp4\">https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/video2.mp4</a></video></div></p>\n<p>So what? Nothing new here up to now. I guess, most of you have written similar applications since ages. OK, let&#8217;s get a bit mean now.</p>\n<p>What about having multiple edit forms open simultaneously , each with a different record?</p>\n<p>From a users perspective this might look like a small extension of the program, but as developers we know that a dataset can have only one current record. If each edit form has to work on its own record, we need a separate dataset for each edit form.</p>\n<p>Before someone suggests to place the dataset back into the form: No, we don&#8217;t want that! In a real world scenario there may be more datasets with complex interactions and business rules to follow. Things never are as simple as shown in a demo.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"color: #808080;\">This seems also a good place to explain the <em>TDataSource should stay in the form</em> rule mentioned in the beginning. </span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"color: #808080;\">The official one is: One can easily change the dataset in the data source of an individual form instance without interferring with others also using a datasource in a datamodule. </span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"color: #808080;\">The unofficial one is: Sometimes the IDE looses these connections, f.i. when the data module cannot be opened. In that case it is easier to re-connect the dataset of one data source on the form instead the data sources of several data controls.</span></p>\n<p>A valid approach is to create a new instance of the data module for each form instance and let the form components use that one. For that we declare a new property in the <em>Edit Form</em> of type <em>TMainDM</em> and create an instance in the forms constructor.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">private\r\n    FDataModule: TMainDM;\r\n  public\r\n    constructor Create(AOwner: TComponent); override;\r\n    property DataModule: TMainDM read FDataModule;\r\n  end;\r\n\r\nconstructor TEditForm.Create(AOwner: TComponent);\r\nbegin\r\n  FDataModule := TMainDM.Create(Self);\r\n  inherited;\r\nend;</pre><p>We remove the <em>Edit Form</em> from the auto-create forms and create a new instance in the button click event &#8211; just like before, but non-modal.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">procedure TMainForm.btnEditClick(Sender: TObject);\r\nvar\r\n  instance: TEditForm;\r\nbegin\r\n  instance := TEditForm.Create(Self);\r\n  instance.Show;\r\nend;</pre><p>Each instance is owned by the main form, so they will be freed when the main form is destroyed.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s see if that is sufficient.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 840px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-1030-3\" width=\"840\" height=\"394\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/video3.mp4?_=3\" /><a href=\"https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/video3.mp4\">https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/video3.mp4</a></video></div>\n<p>Not quite! Although we have separate Edit forms, each with its own local data module instance, the current record still follows the dataset of the main form. Why is that?</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s that magic we saw before, that re-connects the controls at runtime in the same way as we specified in the Designer. For some reason this magic prefers the auto-created instance of the <em>MainDM</em> data module over the local ones in the <em>Edit Form</em>.</p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s have a quick look at the internals behind this magic.</p>\n<p>Peeking in the DFM we see the connection from the data source to the dataset looks like this:</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">object dsData: TDataSource\r\n    DataSet = MainDM.tblData\r\n    Left = 180\r\n    Top = 16\r\n  end</pre><p>The target of this connection is simply the qualified name of the <em>tblData</em> component in the <em>MainDM</em> data module. So the connections are somehow resolved by the <em>components names</em>.</p>\n<p>But wait, the local <em>TMainDM</em> instances are also named <em>MainDM</em>. Why are they just ignored when it comes to finding the <em>MainDM</em> instance to connect the dataset?</p>\n<p>The relevant code is located in the method <em>TReader.DoFixupReferences</em> found in <em>System.Classes</em>:</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">aPropFixup := TPropFixup(FFixups[I]);\r\n        CompName := aPropFixup.FName;\r\n        ReferenceName(CompName);\r\n        Reference := FindNestedComponent(aPropFixup.FInstanceRoot, CompName);\r\n        if (Reference = nil) and Assigned(FOnFindComponentInstance) then\r\n          FOnFindComponentInstance(Self, CompName, Reference);</pre><p>The interesting find is that the reader first tries to find a component inside the root component of the reference to resolve (i.e. <em>TEditForm</em>): <em>FindNestedComponent</em>. Only when no suitable component is found, it asks for the help of <em>FOnFindComponentInstance</em>.</p>\n<p>But when nested components are preferred, our local instance of <em>TMainDM</em> should be found first, shouldn&#8217;t it? Inspecting the code for <em>FindNestedComponent</em> reveals that it actually uses <em>FindComponent</em> inside the Edit Form to access the <em>TMainDM</em> instance. There are two reasons for not finding it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>The instance is not created yet</li>\n<li>The instance has another name as we expect</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We can rule out the first one as we create the instance before we call <em>inherited</em> inside the constructor. That puts the blame on the second one.</p>\n<p>We can find a hint in <em>TReader.ReadRootComponent</em>, where a call to <em>FindUniqueName</em> is responsible for the name change of our local <em>TMainDM</em> instances. As we are not able to change the reader code (at least not willing to do so &#8211; although there are ways), we just have to cope with this name change of our local data module instances.</p>\n<p>How can we do that? As often there is more than one way.</p>\n<p>The easiest one is to simply rename the instance back to its original name. Unless your application relies on unique names for these data modules there should be no harm with this approach.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">procedure ResetComponentName(AComponent: TComponent);\r\nbegin\r\n  AComponent.Name := AComponent.ClassName.Substring(1);\r\nend;\r\n\r\nconstructor TEditForm.Create(AOwner: TComponent);\r\nbegin\r\n  FDataModule := TMainDM.Create(Self);\r\n  ResetComponentName(FDataModule);\r\n  inherited;\r\nend;</pre><p>We also have to synchronize the dataset in the local data module with the current record in the <em>Main Form</em> (We should have done that before, but it wouldn&#8217;t have helped either).</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">procedure TMainForm.btnEditClick(Sender: TObject);\r\nvar\r\n  instance: TEditForm;\r\nbegin\r\n  instance := TEditForm.Create(Self);\r\n  instance.DataModule.SyncRecord(MainDM);\r\n  instance.Show;\r\nend;</pre><p></p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">procedure TMainDM.SyncRecord(Source: TMainDM);\r\nbegin\r\n  if Source = Self then Exit;\r\n\r\n  tblData.Locate(tblDataEMP_NO.FieldName, Source.tblDataEMP_NO.Value);\r\nend;</pre><p><div style=\"width: 840px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-1030-4\" width=\"840\" height=\"406\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/video4.mp4?_=4\" /><a href=\"https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/video4.mp4\">https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/video4.mp4</a></video></div></p>\n<p>Looks much better now, doesn&#8217;t it? And we even haven&#8217;t added much new code to make it work.</p>\n<p>In case you cannot live with the non-unique naming of the local <em>TMainDM</em> instances (they all appear in the <em>Screen.DataModules</em> list), there is another approach: Change all the references to use the new name of the data module. Unfortunately this requires a bit more coding.</p>\n<p>The <em>TReader</em> offers an event <em>OnReferenceName</em>, which is called directly before the <em>FindNestedComponent</em> call in <em>DoFixupReferences</em>. If we could connect a handler to this event, we could change the reference in a suitable way. So how can we get hands on the <em>TReader</em> instance to wire that event?</p>\n<p>In their infinite wisdom the creators of the Delphi component architecture gave us the virtual <em>ReadState</em> method with the current <em>TReader</em> as a parameter. So we override the <em>ReadState</em> in <em>TEditForm</em> and inject our event handler.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">private\r\n    FDataModule: TMainDM;\r\n    FOnReferenceName: TReferenceNameEvent;\r\n  protected\r\n    procedure AdjustReference(var Value: string; AComponent: TComponent);\r\n    procedure MyReferenceName(Reader: TReader; var Name: string);\r\n    procedure ReadState(Reader: TReader); override;\r\n  public\r\n    constructor Create(AOwner: TComponent); override;\r\n    property DataModule: TMainDM read FDataModule;\r\n  end;\r\n\r\nprocedure TEditForm.AdjustReference(var Value: string; AComponent: TComponent);\r\nvar\r\n  fromName: string;\r\n  toName: string;\r\nbegin\r\n  fromName := AComponent.ClassName.Substring(1); // Remove T\r\n  toName := AComponent.Name;\r\n  if Value = fromName then\r\n    Value := toName\r\n  else if Value.StartsWith(fromName + '.') then\r\n    Value := Value.Remove(0, fromName.Length).Insert(0, toName);\r\nend;\r\n\r\nprocedure TEditForm.MyReferenceName(Reader: TReader; var Name: string);\r\nbegin\r\n  AdjustReference(Name, DataModule);\r\n  if Assigned(FOnReferenceName) then\r\n    FOnReferenceName(Reader, Name);\r\nend;\r\n\r\nprocedure TEditForm.ReadState(Reader: TReader);\r\nbegin\r\n  FOnReferenceName := Reader.OnReferenceName;\r\n  try\r\n    Reader.OnReferenceName := MyReferenceName;\r\n    inherited;\r\n  finally\r\n    Reader.OnReferenceName := FOnReferenceName;\r\n  end;\r\nend;</pre><p>Compared to our previous experience that looks like quite a bit of code. For a real world scenario one should consider to place most of the code in a common ancestor class, make <em>MyReferenceName</em> virtual  and simply override it in derived classes where necessary.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">procedure MyReferenceName(Reader: TReader; var Name: string); virtual;\r\n\r\n\r\nprocedure TBaseForm.MyReferenceName(Reader: TReader; var Name: string);\r\nbegin\r\n  if Assigned(FOnReferenceName) then\r\n    FOnReferenceName(Reader, Name);\r\nend;</pre><p></p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">procedure MyReferenceName(Reader: TReader; var Name: string); override;\r\n\r\n\r\nprocedure TEditForm.MyReferenceName(Reader: TReader; var Name: string);\r\nbegin\r\n  AdjustReference(Name, DataModule);\r\n  inherited;\r\nend;</pre><p>Finally, we found a way to use the Delphi Form Designer to connect components between forms, frames and data modules without loosing these connections for multiple, dynamically instantiated instances. A benefit of this approach is the minimal amount of code we have to write &#8211; and less code means less bugs and easier maintenance.</p>\n<p>The sources to the program shown in this article can be downloaded here:<br />\n<a class=\"download-link\" title=\"\" href=\"https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/download/1048/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n\tTweakingDFMLoading.zip</a>.<br />\nYou might have to change the database connection to something you have on your system.

Sometimes there are just some small changes to make the code compile in your current environment, sometimes you correct typos in the comments or string resources, sometimes it is just a better formatting of the code. All of these changes have nothing to do with the current bug to fix or the current feature to implement, but they end up being part of the commit &#8211; and that is just plain wrong! When it comes to commits, make them as small as possible! <span id=\"more-341\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Bigger-is-Not-Always-Better-copy.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-342 size-full\" src=\"https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Bigger-is-Not-Always-Better-copy.jpg\" alt=\"Bigger is Not Always Better\" width=\"537\" height=\"398\" srcset=\"https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Bigger-is-Not-Always-Better-copy.jpg 537w, https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Bigger-is-Not-Always-Better-copy-300x222.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 537px) 85vw, 537px\" /></a></p>\n<p>A changeset is no suitcase to be packed with clothes for all types of occasions. It should have been created for one purpose only in the first place. While it is totally OK to have multiple changesets for one bugfix or feature request or refactoring, it is just bad practice to have one changeset targeting more than one of those.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you are fixing a bug in the release branch and then want to merge it into the develop branch. There is a much lesser chance to encounter any merge conflicts when the changeset only touches the code necessary to fix the bug. Keeping the changeset small can make the difference between an automatic merge and the need for manually resolving conflicts.</p>\n<p>If you are working in an environment that allows to connect the changesets to the corresponding bug or feature in your issue tracker, you can query for those changesets to get an estimate for a similar bug or feature. Some months later it may be quite difficult to separate the unrelated changes from the relevant ones just by analyzing the changeset &#8211; even if it is yourself doing that analysis.</p>\n<p>There are different ways to help you keeping your commits clean. The obvious one is just skipping files that don&#8217;t belong to the change in question. If the change was not done intentionally (be it by yourself or automatically by the IDE), either revert it immediately or keep the change and uncheck the file for the commit. Sometimes the latter may be necessary just to satisfy the IDE.</p>\n<p>The next step is to get into the files content and select only those changes that are necessary. Mercurial and Git (and probably others, too) make this a simple click on a checkbox.</p>\n<p>As a nice side effect you get short commit comments usually fitting in one line, which makes them fully visible in the history.</p>\n<p>I am constantly getting better in this. What about you?</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Delphi Plugins With 10.4 Sydney Support</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/2020/05/26/delphi-plugins-with-10-4-sydney-support/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Uwe Raabe]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 26 May 2020 21:06:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Delphi]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Programming]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Delphi 10.4]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/?p=1004</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[Project Magician, Package Magician and Selective Debugging now support Delphi 10.4 Sydney.]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Project Magician</em>, <em>Package Magician</em> and <em>Selective Debugging</em> now support Delphi 10.4 Sydney.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Delphi 10.4 leverages VCL Styles</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/2020/05/15/delphi-10-4-leverages-vcl-styles/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Uwe Raabe]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 15 May 2020 12:48:35 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Delphi]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Programming]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/?p=983</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[As some of you might have guessed already, I have been a bit busy with the current beta of the new Delphi 10.4 Sidney.

Usually one is not allowed to talk about the beta, but I have been given permission from Embarcadero to blog about some of the new features and improvements. Please note that everything said and shown here is from a pre-release version.</p>\n<p>As David Millington already blogged about <a href=\"https://community.idera.com/developer-tools/b/blog/posts/new-in-delphi-10-4-redesigned-code-insight\">Redesigned Code Insight</a> and Marco Cantú shared brought some newsabout <a href=\"https://community.idera.com/developer-tools/b/blog/posts/custom-managed-records-coming-to-delphi-10-4\">Custom Managed Records</a>, one of my personal favorites are the enhancements related to VCL styles.</p>\n<p>In the past years quite a couple of my customers jumped on the VCL Style train as a simple and effective way to give their applications a fresh and modern look. Interestingly, most of them opted for an individual style tailored to match their corporate design.</p>\n<p>One of these applications makes use of <a href=\"https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/scriptstudiopro.asp\">TMS Scripter</a> to extend the standard functionality with customer designed forms. The Script Designer coming with Scripter is an extremely helpful tool in that.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the Script Designer doesn&#8217;t play well with the VCL style. That would be only a minor problem as the script design is not done very often and then mostly by the service staff. VCL styling is not critical for that. If we only could disable styling only for the designer form.</p>\n<p>Now we can! Delphi 10.4 allows to set different styles per form and even per control.</p>\n<p>That exactly solves the above problem. I can even imagine other use cases for having different styles even for controls on the same form. Some styles differ only marginally and this could be used to highlight several controls on a form more prominent than others.</p>\n<p>This is a sample application with two forms. One form uses the native Windows style and the other uses the <em>Windows10 Green</em> VCL style.

This post is about serializing fields of type <em>TObjectList&lt;T&gt;</em> or descendants thereof.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-964\"></span></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s recap the problem and the final question: The Json serializer does a good job for array of objects, but fails miserably on <em>TObjectList&lt;T&gt;</em> fields.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>What can we do to make serializing generic object lists being serialized properly in both directions?</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>As seen in the previous post, our best bet will be some neat attributes to decorate the fields with. The <em>JsonUTCDate</em> attribute served well, so what about a <em>JsonObjectList</em> attribute registering some fancy interceptor handling the nitty-gritty details. As you might have guessed, this time it is not that easy.</p>\n<p>To populate a generic object list, the serializer must create the individual objects. For that it needs to know the type of these objects. For arrays that is already handled inside <em>TJSONUnMarshal.JSONToTValue</em> by asking RTTI for the <em>ElementType</em>. For a generic object list we must provide that type, so we declare a generic <em>TObjectListInterceptor</em>:</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">type\r\n  TObjectListInterceptor&lt;T: class&gt; = class(TJSONInterceptor)\r\n  public\r\n    procedure AfterConstruction; override;\r\n    function ObjectsConverter(Data: TObject; Field: string): TListOfObjects; override;\r\n    procedure ObjectsReverter(Data: TObject; Field: string; Args: TListOfObjects); override;\r\n  end;\r\n\r\nimplementation\r\n\r\nprocedure TObjectListInterceptor&lt;T&gt;.AfterConstruction;\r\nbegin\r\n  inherited;\r\n  ObjectType := T;\r\nend;\r\n\r\nfunction TObjectListInterceptor&lt;T&gt;.ObjectsConverter(Data: TObject; Field: string): TListOfObjects;\r\nvar\r\n  I: Integer;\r\n  ctx: TRTTIContext;\r\n  list: TObjectList&lt;T&gt;;\r\nbegin\r\n  list := TObjectList&lt;T&gt;(ctx.GetType(Data.ClassType).GetField(Field).GetValue(Data).AsObject);\r\n  SetLength(Result, list.Count);\r\n  for I := 0 to list.Count - 1 do\r\n    Result[I] := list.Items[I];\r\nend;\r\n\r\nprocedure TObjectListInterceptor&lt;T&gt;.ObjectsReverter(Data: TObject; Field: string; Args: TListOfObjects);\r\nvar\r\n  ctx: TRTTIContext;\r\n  list: TObjectList&lt;T&gt;;\r\n  obj: TObject;\r\nbegin\r\n  list := TObjectList&lt;T&gt;(ctx.GetType(Data.ClassType).GetField(Field).GetValue(Data).AsObject);\r\n  list.Clear;\r\n  for obj in Args do\r\n    list.Add(T(obj));\r\nend;</pre><p>The implementation doesn&#8217;t look that complicated, but I want to make clear that we never set the field value! We only use <em>GetValue</em> to get hands on the actual list instance. This has some consequences later, so we better remember it.</p>\n<p>The <em>JsonObjectList</em> attribute takes the actual interceptor class as a parameter and registers it a s <em>ctObjects</em> converter and <em>rtObjects</em> reverter:</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">type\r\n  JsonObjectListAttribute = class(JsonReflectAttribute)\r\n  public\r\n    constructor Create(InterceptorType: TClass);\r\n  end;\r\n\r\nimplementation\r\n\r\nconstructor JsonObjectListAttribute.Create(InterceptorType: TClass);\r\nbegin\r\n  inherited Create(ctObjects, rtObjects, InterceptorType);\r\nend;</pre><p>Let me emphasize the difference of a <em>rtObjects</em> and a <em>rtTypeObjects</em> reverter. The corresponding methods have the following signatures:</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">procedure ObjectsReverter(Data: TObject; Field: string; Args: TListOfObjects);\r\nfunction TypeObjectsReverter(Data: TListOfObjects): TObject;</pre><p>You can see that <em>ObjectsReverter</em> is meant to handle the <em>Args</em> list (which is basically an <em>array of TObject</em>)  by doing whatever is necessary to the <em>Field</em> of the <em>Data</em> object. Meanwhile the <em>TypeObjectsReverter</em> must return an instance built from the <em>Args</em> list, which is going to replace any existing instance present in the object field. For this to work, we need the actual type of the list &#8211; in addition to the element type.</p>\n<p>The cast to <em>TObjectList&lt;T&gt;</em> seen above works simply because we are acting on the actual field instance with the correct type and it just happens that the called methods <em>Count</em>, <em>Clear</em> and <em>Add</em> wire directly on the <em>FListHelper</em> instance unaffected of the actual type &lt;T&gt;.</p>\n<p>The choose of a <em>rtObjects</em> reverter requires the element type as the only generic type parameter. I will later explain why a derived <em>TObjectList&lt;T&gt;</em> cannot be decorated with a <em>rtTypeObjects</em> attribute, ruling out such an approach.</p>\n<p>Now we want to make use of the new attribute and see how it works for a generic object list field of our class.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">type\r\n  TMyAddressBook = class\r\n  private\r\n    [JsonObjectList(TObjectListListInterceptor&lt;TContact&gt;)]\r\n    FContacts: TObjectList&lt;TContact&gt;;</pre><p>Unfortunately that doesn&#8217;t even compile! It turned out that the compiler is not able to resolve the instantiated generic type <em>TObjectListListInterceptor&lt;TContact&gt;</em> used as a parameter for the <em>JsonObjectList</em> attribute. We have to declare an alias for that to make it work.</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">type\r\n  TContactList = TIdentList&lt;TContact&gt;;\r\n  TContactListInterceptor = TObjectListInterceptor&lt;TContact&gt;;\r\n\r\ntype\r\n  TMyAddressBook = class\r\n  private\r\n    [JsonObjectList(TContactListInterceptor)]\r\n    FContacts: TContactList;\r\n    ...</pre><p>Note that we need at least one <em>type</em> keyword between the alias and its use inside the attribute.</p>\n<p>Are we finished now?</p>\n<p>Ehm, no! Perhaps you remember me saying &#8220;I want to make clear that we never set the field value!&#8221;. That sentence assumes that there already is an instance of <em>TContactList</em> present in the <em>FContacts</em> field.</p>\n<p>No problem, we can create that instance in the <em>constructor</em> and free it in the <em>destructor</em>. We probably would have done that anyway. Unfortunately that isn&#8217;t enough. The standard implementation replaces all instances in the fields with <em>nil</em> before doing any de-serialization of an object and frees those saved field instances after the field gets a new valid instance created in between &#8211;</p>\n<p>&#8211; unless we tell not to do so.</p>\n<p>The attribute for skipping the destruction of the field instances is <em>JSONOwned</em> with parameter <em>False</em>. The final attribute decoration for a generic object list field now looks like this:</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">type\r\n  TMyAddressBook = class\r\n  private\r\n    [JSONOwned(False), JsonObjectList(TContactListInterceptor)]\r\n    FContacts: TContactList;\r\n    ...</pre><p>There we are! Now we are able to use generic object lists as fields while still serializing them as object arrays and vice versa. The additional declaration of an interceptor alias and the per field decoration with some attributes seems acceptable given this advantage.</p>\n<p>Why no attribute directly for <em>TContactList</em>?</p>\n<p>You remember that the <em>TypeObjectsReverter</em> needs to know the actual list class. A possible declaration might be <em>TObjectListInterceptor&lt;T: class, ListT: TObjectList&lt;T&gt;&gt;</em>, which is indeed possible to implement. The problem is the use of the attribute which would have to be like this:</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">type\r\n  TContactListInterceptor = class;\r\n\r\n  [JsonObjectList(TContactListInterceptor)]\r\n  TContactList = TObjectList&lt;TContact&gt;;\r\n\r\n  TContactListInterceptor = TObjectListInterceptor&lt;TContact, TContactList&gt;;</pre><p>Unfortunately this doesn&#8217;t compile, because <em>TContactListInterceptor</em> is not fully defined when used in the attribute. We need to fully define the interceptor class using <em>TContactList</em> before we can decorate <em>TContactList</em> with that attribute. If anyone comes up with a workaround, tell me.</p>\n<p>The source code used in this article can be found at <a href=\"https://github.com/UweRaabe/REST-JSon-Helpers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/UweRaabe/REST-JSon-Helpers</a></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Serializing Objects with TJson</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/2020/03/02/serializing-objects-with-tjson/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Uwe Raabe]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 02 Mar 2020 16:44:33 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Delphi]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Programming]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[JSON]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Serialization]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/?p=956</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[Serializing objects to Json as well as de-serializing them with the Delphi standard libraries has been subject to many discussions.

While the majority suggests to use another library or a self implemented solution, there are others who would prefer the built-in tools for a couple of reasons. Simplicity and the availability with every (decent) Delphi installation being the most mentioned ones.</p>\n<p>The ease and elegance of a <em>TRESTRequest.AddBody&lt;T&gt;(myInstance)</em> call is hard to attain with other means. I guess it is not myself alone being tempted to make use of it. With a bit of care taken when designing the objects to serialize the results are often quite satisfying and fit the requirements. Nourishing this with some advanced techniques shown in this post may be enough to keep the benefits without the need for external code.<span id=\"more-956\"></span></p>\n<p>If we inspect the above mentioned generic <em>AddBody</em> method we soon find out that the serializing part is outsourced to the <em>TJson.ObjectToJsonObject</em> method. We make a note that the call just accepts the default <em>TJsonOptions</em> for the second parameter.</p>\n<p>Without any tweaking the Json serializer takes each field of the class, where it does a pretty good job for simple (value) types, objects and arrays of both. In reality the use of object arrays as fields inside a class is rarely a valid approach. Generic object lists derived from <em>TObjectList&lt;T&gt;</em> are way more feasible and thus the preferred way to go. Unfortunately those are not handled pretty well and in most cases are they even not what a non Delphi counterparts accept or deliver &#8211; mostly they use arrays for these lists. The ultimate question now is:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>What can we do to make serializing generic object lists being serialized properly in both directions?</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>I hate to disappoint you, but the generic object lists will be covered in the <a href=\"https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/2020/03/02/serializing-generic-object-lists-with-tjson/\">next blog post</a>, while this one tackles an easier task &#8211; it would have been too long otherwise.</p>\n<p>Although the Json serializing is quite resistant to extensions, there are means to achieve more than appears possible on a first look. The allies in this endeavor are attributes.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with a simple task as a warm-up. As mentioned above, the <em>AddBody</em> method uses the default <em>TJsonOptions</em> for the <em>ObjectToJsonObject</em> call, which are <em>joDateIsUTC</em> and <em>joDateFormatISO8601</em>. While the date format is not a bad choice, the requirements to provide UTC dates may force some work unwanted on us. What if we could just say: <em>Hey, this is a TDateTime field, but I want it to be converted to UTC in the Json representation. In addition there should be a null date equivalent to the ISO string &#8220;0000-00-00T00:00:00.000Z&#8221;, but the Json for that shall be a null value for these instead of that string value.</em> To abbreviate this information we want an attribute named <em>JsonUTCDate</em>, so that a field declaration should look like this:</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">[JsonUTCDate]\r\n    FStartDate: TDateTime;\r\n    [JsonUTCDate]\r\n    FEndDate: TDateTime;</pre><p>OK, this is the new attribute declaration and its implementation:</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">type\r\n  JsonUTCDateAttribute = class(JsonReflectAttribute)\r\n  public\r\n    constructor Create;\r\n  end;\r\n\r\nimplementation\r\n\r\nconstructor JsonUTCDateAttribute.Create;\r\nbegin\r\n  inherited Create(ctObject, rtString, TUTCDateTimeInterceptor);\r\nend;</pre><p>Pretty simple &#8211; because we delegate the actual work to a class named <em>TUTCDateTimeInterceptor</em>, which we will have a look at later. For the moment we notice that the <em>JsonUTCDate</em> attribute registers different types for the converter and the reverter. The interceptor acts as a <em>ctObject</em> converter, but as a <em>rtString</em> reverter. While we could accomplish most of the task also with a <em>ctString</em> converter, the demand for the null value requires us to exchange the Json string value with a Json <em>null</em> value. A <em>ctString</em> converter cannot be used for that.</p>\n<p>The <em>TUTCDateTimeInterceptor</em> is derived from <em>TJSONInterceptor</em> and overrides the methods <em>ObjectConverter</em> and <em>StringReverter</em> according to the values given in <em>JsonUTCDateAttribute.Create</em>. The implementation for <em>StringReverter</em> is pretty straight forward based on the original implementation found in <em>TISODateTimeInterceptor</em> decorated with a call to a small function <em>ToLocalTime</em>, which takes care of the <em>null</em> date value (We don&#8217;t want the <em>null</em> date being converted to local time, do we?):</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">const\r\n  cNoDate = -DateDelta;\r\n\r\nfunction IsNoDate(ADate: TDateTime): Boolean;\r\nbegin\r\n  Result := Round(ADate) = cNoDate;\r\nend;\r\nfunction TUTCDateTimeInterceptor.ToLocalTime(const ADateTime: TDateTime): TDateTime;\r\nbegin\r\n  Result := ADateTime;\r\n  if not IsNodate(Result) then\r\n    Result := TTimeZone.Local.ToLocalTime(Result);\r\nend;\r\n\r\nprocedure TUTCDateTimeInterceptor.StringReverter(Data: TObject; Field, Arg: string);\r\nvar\r\n  ctx: TRTTIContext;\r\n  datetime: TDateTime;\r\nbegin\r\n  datetime := ToLocalTime(ISO8601ToDate(Arg));\r\n  ctx.GetType(Data.ClassType).GetField(Field).SetValue(Data, datetime);\r\nend;</pre><p>The ObjectConverter method is a bit more sophisticated to achieve the null value requirement:</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">function TUTCDateTimeInterceptor.ToUniversalTime(const ADateTime: TDateTime; const ForceDaylight: Boolean): TDateTime;\r\nbegin\r\n  Result := ADateTime;\r\n  if not IsNoDate(Result) then\r\n    Result := TTimeZone.Local.ToUniversalTime(Result, ForceDaylight);\r\nend;\r\n\r\nfunction TUTCDateTimeInterceptor.ObjectConverter(Data: TObject; Field: string): TObject;\r\nvar\r\n  ctx: TRTTIContext;\r\n  date: TDateTime;\r\nbegin\r\n  Result := nil;\r\n  date := ctx.GetType(Data.ClassType).GetField(Field).GetValue(Data).AsType&lt;TDateTime&gt;;\r\n  if IsNoDate(date) then Exit;\r\n  StringProxy.Value := DateToISO8601(ToUniversalTime(date));\r\n  result := StringProxy;\r\nend;</pre><p>First it takes the current date value from the field and checks for the <em>null</em> date, exiting with a <em>nil</em> result if found. A <em>nil</em> object will end up as a <em>null</em> in the Json string.</p>\n<p>For all other dates we convert to UTC with the <em>ToUniversalTime</em> method. Alas, we cannot return the resulting string directly &#8211; we need to return an object. For this we use a local instance of a <em>TStringProxy</em> object, for which we have taken ownership to avoid memory leaks. The <em>TStringProxy</em> class is decorated with <em>ctTypeString</em> interceptor to just retrieve the plain string. If we omit that we get an inner object containing the value as a separate field instead of just the value for the current <em>TDateTime</em> field.</p>\n<p>This is the complete class declaration for <em>TUTCDateTimeInterceptor</em> together with the missing methods:</p><pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">type\r\n  TUTCDateTimeInterceptor = class(TJSONInterceptor)\r\n  private type\r\n    TStringProxyInterceptor = class(TJSONInterceptor)\r\n    public\r\n      function TypeStringConverter(Data: TObject): string; override;\r\n    end;\r\n    [JsonReflect(ctTypeString, rtTypeString, TStringProxyInterceptor)]\r\n    TStringProxy = class\r\n    private\r\n      FValue: string;\r\n    public\r\n      property Value: string read FValue write FValue;\r\n    end;\r\n  var\r\n    FStringProxy: TStringProxy;\r\n    function GetStringProxy: TStringProxy;\r\n  strict protected\r\n    function ToLocalTime(const ADateTime: TDateTime): TDateTime;\r\n    function ToUniversalTime(const ADateTime: TDateTime; const ForceDaylight: Boolean = False): TDateTime;\r\n    property StringProxy: TStringProxy read GetStringProxy;\r\n  public\r\n    destructor Destroy; override;\r\n    procedure StringReverter(Data: TObject; Field: string; Arg: string); override;\r\n    function ObjectConverter(Data: TObject; Field: string): TObject; override;\r\n  end;\r\n\r\nfunction TUTCDateTimeInterceptor.GetStringProxy: TStringProxy;\r\nbegin\r\n  if FStringProxy = nil then begin\r\n    FStringProxy := TStringProxy.Create;\r\n  end;\r\n  Result := FStringProxy;\r\nend;\r\n\r\ndestructor TUTCDateTimeInterceptor.Destroy;\r\nbegin\r\n  FStringProxy.Free;\r\n  inherited Destroy;\r\nend;</pre><p>That&#8217;s it for now.

(Now you can estimate my age <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f609.png\" alt=\"😉\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> )</p>\n<p>At that time I had been working with <em>Turbo Pascal</em> for a couple of years, starting with TP 2, and I was able to make a decent living as an independent developer. While still investigating the usefulness of <em>Turbo Pascal for Windows</em>, the sudden availability of Delphi was a massive game changer.</p>\n<p>I am not going to repeat the story <a href=\"https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/2013/02/15/18-years-of-delphi-programming/\">I told you some years ago</a>. Today I have a more recent one.</p>\n<p>Some years ago I was asked to port a long grown Delphi 5 application to the then current Delphi version. The developer in charge didn&#8217;t have the capacity to do that, so they looked for external help and, well, I got the gig. After the port was finished I am still occasionally working on that project when they need some help.</p>\n<p>Once I became aware that the customer was planning to create a complete new version of that software written in C#. I was a bit miffed as they didn&#8217;t even bother to ask me doing that in Delphi. So I just asked if I may at least make an offer.</p>\n<p>They were pretty skeptic about a Delphi solution:</p>\n<p><em>But we don&#8217;t want the Windows look. We rather have some individual look, matching our corporate identity.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>No problem. We can use a style made just for you.</em></p>\n<p><em>But it has to work on a touch screen.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>Delphi supports that out of the box.</em></p>\n<p><em>But we need a mobile version, too.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>So, what?</em></p>\n<p><em>(some more objections &#8211; easily overruled)</em></p>\n<p>They handed me some drafts of the different screens, so I could see what they were after. In a few days I was able to create a prototype with Delphi, that not only resembles their drafts pretty close, but also showed some meaningful actions when clicking buttons and switching tabs. Some cool controls from TMS helped a lot for the first impression.</p>\n<p>Somehow I could figure the cost the other company estimated &#8211; a mid six digit number. My offer was about 10 &#8211; 20% of that. I also teased with having a working solution for the upcoming exhibition &#8211; something unthinkable by others.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile the C# endeavor is long forgotten. There is still some skepticism about Delphi, no matter what results we show &#8211; seems to be some genetic thing.</p>\n<p>In the movie <em>Something’s Gotta Give</em> the great <em>Jack Nicholson</em> describes women between 25 and 30 as <em>when everything fits</em>. Seems there are some great times ahead&#8230;</p>\n<p>#Delphi25th</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Project Magician V1.0.16 released</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/2019/11/25/project-magician-v1-0-16-released/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Uwe Raabe]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2019 13:41:15 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Delphi]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Programming]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/?p=943</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[Seems Delphi 10.3.3 Rio adds some bogus entries for Android 64 into the dproj files when opening a project from a previous version.

I learned so much. (Rather I had to unlearn things to relearn them.) While I may not say everything correctly 100% of the time yet since I am still memorizing all the rules and still training myself to forget what I was taught before, I have noticed I am starting to hear the sounds (or what letter they are pronounced like) correctly more often than I was before. Plus when I forget a rule while I&#8217;m studying and the word I hear sounds different from what I said I now understand why and I know there is just a rule there that I just need more practice with. It is a much better and more reassuring situation than before where someone was telling me &#8220;this is how this one word is pronounced but that is all you&#8217;re going to get for this lesson. figure the rest out for yourself.&#8221; Thank you TTMIK.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Carrie P.</strong></div>\n<div></div>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Love these.

You&#8217;ll save yourself a LOT of confusion and stress.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Barbara B.</strong></div>\n<div class=\"crm-lesson\">\n<h2>Table of contents</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Diphthongs: Why don&#8217;t Koreans pronounce 의 as 의?</li>\n<li>Long/Short Vowel Sounds: Are 눈(snow) and 눈(eye) pronounced differently?</li>\n<li>Batchim: 빋 = 빗 = 빚 = 빛 = 빝 = 빟</li>\n<li>Compound Consonants as Batchim: Should I pronounce the ㄹ or ㄱ in 읽다?</li>\n<li>Assimilation Part 1: 닫히다 and 다치다 are pronounced exactly the same way.</li>\n<li>Assimilation Part 2: ㄴ always becomes ㄹ when it&#8217;s with ㄹ.</li>\n<li>Fortition Part 1: Why is 박주연 pronounced 박쭈연?</li>\n<li>Fortition Part 2: Why is 갈 거예요 pronounced 갈 꺼예요?</li>\n<li>ㄴ Insertion: Why isn&#8217;t 꽃잎 pronounced 꼬칲?</li>\n<li>ㅅ Insertion: Why isn&#8217;t 나뭇잎 pronounced 나무싶?</li>\n<li>Ending Consonant Sounds: Ignore the romanizations.</li>\n<li>ㄴ vs N</li>\n<li>ㄹ vs L</li>\n<li>ㄷ vs D</li>\n<li>Differentiating ㅈ, ㅊ, and ㅉ</li>\n<li>Differentiating ㄱ, ㅋ, and ㄲ</li>\n<li>Differentiating ㅂ, ㅍ, and ㅃ</li>\n<li>Differentiating ㅅ and ㅆ</li>\n<li>Differentiating ㄷ, ㅌ, and ㄸ</li>\n<li>오 vs 어</li>\n<li>요 vs 여</li>\n<li>으 vs 우</li>\n<li>When Spelling and Pronunciation Are Different</li>\n<li>English Loan Words</li>\n<li>Korean Words English Speakers Know</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://talktomeinkorean.com/restriction-message-korean-pronunciation-guide-2/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>\n\r\n<!--\r\nPerformance optimized by W3 Total Cache.

Instead of tag for each file type browser can easily know how to execute the above tags.</p>\n<p><strong>&lt;form: form&gt;</strong></p>\n<p>Tag will be used for creating new form and will contain the attributes method and action. Method can be POST or GET. Action would be for the destination of the data.</p>\n<p><strong>&lt;form: input&gt;</strong></p>\n<p>Tag will be used for taking input from the users. Here are the possible input types which can be included in HTML6.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>email</li>\n<li>text</li>\n<li>tel</li>\n<li>url</li>\n<li>number</li>\n<li>search</li>\n<li>datetime</li>\n<li>week</li>\n<li>month</li>\n<li>date</li>\n<li>time</li>\n<li>textarea</li>\n<li>datetime-local</li>\n<li>password</li>\n<li>file – (multiple)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The possible attributes on input are:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>name</li>\n<li>disabled</li>\n<li>readonly</li>\n<li>required</li>\n<li>autofocus</li>\n<li>placeholder</li>\n<li>novalidate</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The following are attributes that will work on any input except file inputs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>maxlength</li>\n<li>autocomplete</li>\n<li>spellcheck</li>\n<li>pattern</li>\n<li>match – New to HTML6.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>&lt;form: select&gt;</strong></p>\n<p>Tag is for selecting the options and also similar to the current &lt;input&gt; tag.

This can be useful for upload progress bar. It will be similar to &lt;progress&gt; and &lt;meter&gt; in HTML5.</p>\n<p>Attributes that will work for all status types are min, max, value.</p>\n<p><strong>&lt;form: label&gt;</strong><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>Tag can be used for labelling the input for the users.</p>\n<p><strong>&lt;form: submit&gt;</strong></p>\n<p>Tag will be used for submitting the input and is similar to &lt;input type=”submit”&gt; tag. Attributes that work for the &lt;form: submit&gt; tag are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>value</li>\n<li>name</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are some more changes that can be included in the HTML6 for better compatibility and user experience. Given below are some of them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HTML6 dedicated libraries</li>\n<li>Freedom to Resize image</li>\n<li>Express Tags</li>\n<li>Annotations for images and videos</li>\n<li>Authentication Enhancement</li>\n<li>Better contact Information</li>\n<li>Pluggable languages</li>\n<li>Pluggable pre-processors</li>\n<li>Camera Integration</li>\n<li>Stronger micro-formats</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>HTML6 Dedicated Libraries</strong><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>For libraries that are very large requires a lot of issues and for this a cacheable version of libraries can be introduced in HTML6 for the ease of using and loading other libraries.</p>\n<p><strong>Freedom to Resize image</strong></p>\n<p>For better viewing experience and new tag &lt;srcset&gt; can be introduced in this version. In this browser can be able to resize and adjust the image according to window size and device resolution. <strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Express Tags</strong></p>\n<p>&lt;logo&gt; &lt;/logo&gt; for the logo on the page, &lt;sidebar&gt; &lt;/sidebar&gt;, &lt;navigation&gt; &lt;/navigation&gt; are some express tags.</p>\n<p><strong>Annotations for Images and Videos</strong></p>\n<p>In HTML5 we can annotate words but not images and videos but in this version annotations for videos and images also can be included.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Authentication Enhancement</strong></p>\n<p>Although HTML5 was good in terms of security and authentication but for more better security keys can be stored off-site as to prevent people from gaining access. Therefore it can also be accepted by WHATWG.</p>\n<p><strong>Better Contact Information</strong></p>\n<p>Sometimes for pulling out our contact number, email we have to cut and paste it. A better contact information system can be included in this version.</p>\n<p><strong>Pluggable Languages</strong></p>\n<p>Effective and pluggable languages would be included in this version so that developers would be able to create a unique design within time and the browser would be able to easily implement this feature within a few steps.</p>\n<p><strong>Pluggable Preprocessors</strong></p>\n<p>Pre-processors are also present in the current HTML version. But in the new version, it would be optimized and will open a new window for developers.</p>\n<p><strong>Camera Integration</strong></p>\n<p>We generally use cameras and microphones for interacting with people. HTML6  would help us to access our media located in our device and we will get better control of the microphone and camera.</p>\n<p><strong>Stronger Micro-formats</strong></p>\n<p>There are some tags in HTML such as footer, paragraph, headline but it would be more efficient if standard web page sections are included such as address or phone number. It would boost the speed and quality of website.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/vpwM-Z0rSUM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>There is no perfect language exist and there is always a chance of improvement. There is no official news yet but HTML6 will soon be released in the market and will be available for users. Hopefully, it will be better and easier to use than older versions.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/2021/02/html6.html\">HTML6 &#8211; New Features Expected and Release Date</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com\">The Crazy Programmer</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/2021/02/html6.html/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Invert a Binary Tree &#8211; Recursive and Iterative Approach in Java</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/2021/02/invert-a-binary-tree.html</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<comments>https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/2021/02/invert-a-binary-tree.html#respond</comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Vijay Sinha]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2021 08:05:26 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[DSA]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/?p=10850</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>In this article we have a look at another interesting problem related to binary tree.

Given a binary tree we have to invert the tree and print it.

In simple terms, it is a tree whose left children and right children of all non-leaf nodes are swapped.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The leaf nodes will also get interchanged. It is recommended to learn In-Order and Post Order traversal before proceeding with this problem.</p>\n<p>Let us look at an example of a binary tree:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10853\" src=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Invert-Binary-Tree.png\" alt=\"Invert a Binary Tree\" width=\"902\" height=\"430\" srcset=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Invert-Binary-Tree.png 902w, https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Invert-Binary-Tree-300x143.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the above figure we see the sample tree and it&#8217;s inverted or mirror version.</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">Input:             20                                                  \r\n                /       \\\r\n               /         \\\r\n              10          30                      \r\n            /   \\        /   \\\r\n           /     \\      /     \\\r\n          5      15    25      35                \r\n\r\n\r\nOutput:            20                                                  \r\n                /       \\\r\n               /         \\\r\n              30          10                      \r\n            /   \\        /   \\\r\n           /     \\      /     \\\r\n          35      25   5      15</pre><p></p>\n<h2>Approach 1 (Recursive Approach)</h2>\n<p>Follow these steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We basically do a Post-Order <a href=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/2019/09/tree-traversal.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Traversal</a> of our tree starting from the root where we traverse for the left subtree first and then the right subtree before processing the root.</li>\n<li>At time of processing the root of each node we swap their left and right child respectively if their children are not null.</li>\n<li>We also check if the given root of binary tree is null or not.

We also look at description of <a href=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/2016/11/lru-page-replacement-algorithm-c.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LRU Cache</a> with some examples. Then, we look at the implementation of this design in code with their complexity analysis.</p>\n<p>Caching is a method of organizing data in a faster memory, usually RAM to serve future requests of same data in a efficient way. It avoids repetitive main memory access by storing frequently accessed data in cache. However, the Cache size is usually not big enough to store large data sets compared to main memory. So, there is a need for cache eviction when it becomes full. There are many algorithms to implement cache eviction. LRU caching is a commonly used cache replacement algorithm.</p>\n<p><strong>Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache</strong> organizes data according to their usage, allowing us to identify which data item hasn&#8217;t been used for the longest amount of time. The main idea is to evict the oldest data or the least recently used from the cache to accommodate more data followed with replacement of data if already present in the cache (<strong>Cache Hit</strong>) and bring it in the front or top of the cache for quick access.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10840 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/LRU-Cache.png\" alt=\"LRU Cache\" width=\"1004\" height=\"617\" srcset=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/LRU-Cache.png 1004w, https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/LRU-Cache-300x184.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1004px) 100vw, 1004px\" /></p>\n<h4>Example:</h4>\n<p>Let&#8217;s consider a cache of capacity 4 with elements already present as:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-10841 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-33-300x78.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"78\" srcset=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-33-300x78.png 300w, https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-33.png 996w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p>Elements are added in order 1,2,3 and 4. Suppose we need to cache or add another element 5 into our cache, so after adding 5 following LRU Caching the cache looks like this:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-10842\" src=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-34-300x77.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"77\" srcset=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-34-300x77.png 300w, https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-34.png 1023w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p>So, element 5 is at the top of the cache. Element 2 is the least recently used or the oldest data in cache. Now if we want to access element 2 again from the cache. The cache becomes:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-10843\" src=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-35-300x77.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"77\" srcset=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-35-300x77.png 300w, https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-35.png 1022w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p>So, element 2 comes to the top of the cache. Element 3 is the least recent used data and next in line for eviction.</p>\n<h2>LRU Cache Implementation</h2>\n<p>We follow these steps to implement a LRU Cache in our program:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We use two Data Structures a <strong>Deque or Doubly Ended Queue</strong>, where insertion and deletion can take place from both ends and a <a href=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/2015/06/java-hashmap-with-example.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Hash-Map</strong></a>. The Deque will act as our Cache.</li>\n<li>In Queue, we enter each element at first/front of the queue, so we use a Deque. If we need to access any element already present in our cache we search that element in queue, remove it and then add it to the front of the queue/cache. But searching an element in queue could take O(n) time in worst case and will be a costly operation.</li>\n<li>So, to avoid this we use a <strong>Hash-Map</strong> which provides look-up or search time for our keys in O(1) time. Then, we can directly delete the element without the need to search in cache. So if our Hash-Map contains the data then we can just bring that element to the front of queue and add data as entry to our map for future look-ups.</li>\n<li>If our capacity is full then we remove from the rear end of <a href=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/2014/02/c-program-for-various-operations-on-a-dequeue-represented-using-a-circular-array.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deque</a> which contains least recent data. Along with this, we remove the entry of the element from our Map.</li>\n<li>So, we mainly need to implement two methods for our cache: One to get element from cache and other to add element into our cache following the LRU algorithm and above steps.</li>\n<li>In get method we need to just get the value of data item if it&#8217;s present in our cache. In put method we add the data into our cache and the Map and update the order of cache elements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Why Hash-Map not Hash-Set?</h3>\n<p>Since we only need to search whether an element is present in our cache or not we can also do it by using a Hash-Set then what is the purpose of Hash-Map. The reason is while accessing resources from the Cache a key is required to access the data. The key will be unique for each data. So with the key we can access the actual data. In real life scenario, for a product there can be many attributes we need to access with the product key. As we know, Hash-Map stores data in Key-Value Pair the Key Field holds the key of data and Value field can hold the actual data or attributes.</p>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s look at the implementation of above in Java:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">//import the required collection classes\r\nimport java.util.Deque;\r\nimport java.util.HashMap;\r\nimport java.util.LinkedList;\r\nimport java.util.Map;\r\n\r\nclass CacheObject \r\n{\r\n  int key;              // key to access actual data\r\n  String value;         // data to be accessed by cache\r\n  \r\n  CacheObject(int key, String value) {\r\n    this.key = key;\r\n    this.value = value;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class LRUCache {\r\n  \r\n  //  queue which acts as Cache to store data.\r\n  static Deque&lt;Integer&gt; q = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;(); \r\n  \r\n  // Map to store key value pair of data items.\r\n  static Map&lt;Integer, CacheObject&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\r\n  int CACHE_CAPACITY = 4;\r\n\r\n  public String getElementFromCache(int key) // get data from cache if key is already present.\r\n  {\r\n      \r\n    // if item present in cache remove and add to front of cache\r\n    if(map.containsKey(key)) \r\n    {\r\n      CacheObject current = map.get(key);\r\n      q.remove(current.key);\r\n      q.addFirst(current.key);\r\n      return current.value;\r\n    } \r\n    \r\n    return \"No such element present in Cache\";\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  public void putElementInCache(int key, String value) \r\n  {\r\n    if(map.containsKey(key)) \r\n    {\r\n      CacheObject curr = map.get(key);     // we check if element already present in cache through Map\r\n      q.remove(curr.key);                  // remove if already present\r\n    }\r\n    else \r\n    {\r\n      if(q.size() == CACHE_CAPACITY) \r\n      {\r\n        int temp = q.removeLast();  // if cache size is full we remove from last of queue\r\n        map.remove(temp);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // then we just add already present item or new item with given key and value.\r\n    \r\n    CacheObject newItem = new CacheObject(key, value);\r\n    q.addFirst(newItem.key);   \r\n    map.put(key, newItem);\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  // Driver Code to test above methods.\r\n  public static void main(String[] args) \r\n  {\r\n    \r\n    LRUCache cache = new LRUCache();\r\n    cache.putElementInCache(1, \"Product-A-Name\");\r\n    cache.putElementInCache(2, \"Product-B-Name\");\r\n    cache.putElementInCache(3, \"Product-C-Name\");\r\n    cache.putElementInCache(4, \"Product-D-Name\");\r\n    \r\n    // We get 2 from cache\r\n    System.out.println(cache.getElementFromCache(2));\r\n    System.out.println();\r\n    \r\n    // We print our queue and see 2 will be at front of cache    \r\n    System.out.println(q);\r\n    System.out.println();\r\n    \r\n    //Element 5 is not present in Cache\r\n    System.out.println(cache.getElementFromCache(5));\r\n    cache.putElementInCache(5,\"Product-E-Name\");\r\n    System.out.println();\r\n    \r\n    //Now after adding 5 in cache it will be at front and 1 is deleted.\r\n    System.out.println(q);\r\n    System.out.println();\r\n    \r\n  }\r\n\r\n}</pre><p><strong>Output:</strong></p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">Product-B-Name\r\n\r\n[2, 4, 3, 1]\r\n\r\nNo such element present in Cache\r\n\r\n[5, 2, 4, 3]</pre><p>So this was the implementation of LRU Cache in code let&#8217;s have a look at the time and space complexities of our approach.</p>\n<p><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> Basically we implement this cache in <strong>O(1)</strong> time, as the search for an element present in cache require constant time and with our Map the search time is also constant.

We will see the description of both along with how to define a schema and create attributes in a table with these constraints.</p>\n<h2>Primary Key</h2>\n<p>A Primary Key is a key attribute or a column which is used to uniquely identify a row (tuple) in a table (relation). It maintains the integrity constraints of a table. A table can have only one primary key attribute. The data of primary key must be unique. Hence, no duplicate values are valid. Also, no <strong>NULL</strong> (empty) values are allowed during insertion as it violates the integrity constraint. The database automatically creates a<strong> Clustered Index</strong> over primary key which orders data on the basis of primary key.</p>\n<p>We define a Primary Key Attribute as follows:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">Column_Name DataType PRIMARY KEY</pre><p></p>\n<h2>Unique Key</h2>\n<p>A Unique Key is a constraint or key attribute which also uniquely identifies a row in a table. It&#8217;s purpose is somewhat same as primary key. It differs in ways such as a table can have one or more than one Unique keys. It allows the possibility of NULL value insertion limited to only one null value insertion. In other words, Unique Key Constraints allow a column to have only one NULL value. No duplicate values are permitted. By default, the Unique key are generated in a <strong>Non-Clustered Index</strong>.</p>\n<p>We define a Unique Key Attribute as follows while creating a table:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">Column_Name Datatype UNIQUE</pre><p>Now let us look at an example of creating a table with these constraints:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">CREATE TABLE CARS\r\n(\r\nCar_Id INT PRIMARY KEY,\r\nCar_Brand VARCHAR(10),\r\nCar_NumberPlate VARCHAR(10) UNIQUE\r\n);</pre><p>Here <strong>Car_Id</strong> is the Primary key and <strong>Car_NumberPlate</strong> is the Unique Key of table CARS.</p>\n<p>Let us assume we have these records in table CARS:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-10825 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-27.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"833\" height=\"135\" srcset=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-27.png 833w, https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-27-300x49.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 833px) 100vw, 833px\" /></p>\n<p>If we add a record like this:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">INSERT INTO CARS VALUES(3,'Hyundai','');</pre><p>This will add the record successfully since the unique key Car_NumberPlate allows one null value and show contents of database:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-10826 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-30.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1157\" height=\"140\" srcset=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-30.png 1157w, https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-30-300x36.png 300w, https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-30-1024x124.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1157px) 100vw, 1157px\" /></p>\n<p>If we add any duplicate value in Primary key field Car_Id, it will show us error</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">INSERT INTO CARS VALUES(3,'Honda','TN056789');</pre><p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-10831 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Differencebetweenprimarykeyandunique.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1048\" height=\"175\" srcset=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Differencebetweenprimarykeyandunique.png 1048w, https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Differencebetweenprimarykeyandunique-300x50.png 300w, https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Differencebetweenprimarykeyandunique-1024x171.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" /></p>\n<p>So, when we try entering duplicate values to our Primary key Car_Id it shows the Unique constraint of the field is violated.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/2019/04/difference-between-primary-key-and-foreign-key.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Difference between Primary Key and Foreign Key</a></p></blockquote>\n<h2>Difference between Primary Key and Unique Key</h2>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s look at the key differences between them:</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; text-align: center;\"><strong>Primary Key</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; text-align: center;\"><strong>Unique Key</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">1.

We discuss our approach to solve this problem and analyze the time and space complexities.</p>\n<p>It is recommended to first learn <a href=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/2021/02/top-view-of-binary-tree.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Top View Of Binary Tree</a> before proceeding with this problem. A lot of the implementation is based on the Top View Approach.</p>\n<p>By Bottom View of Binary Tree, we mean the nodes visible when the tree is viewed from the bottom or from the leaves. A node is present in our bottom view it is the last node or the bottom-most node at it&#8217;s respective horizontal distance.</p>\n<p>We calculate the horizontal distance of each node as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We fix the Horizontal Distance of Root of tree=0.</li>\n<li>Then, Horizontal Distance of Left Child=Horizontal Distance of it’s Parent Node – 1.</li>\n<li>Horizontal Distance of Right Child=Horizontal Distance of it’s Parent Node + 1.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now let us look into an example. Consider this binary tree:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-10814 alignnone\" src=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tree-3.png\" alt=\"Bottom View of Binary Tree in Java\" width=\"279\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tree-3.png 279w, https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tree-3-261x300.png 261w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 279px) 100vw, 279px\" /></p>\n<p>The Bottom View of this tree will be : 2 5 6 7.</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>The nodes highlighted in the figure above represent the bottom view. We start from the root node 1 at level 1 the horizontal distance is fixed at 0, then we traverse each level and print the bottom-most node for that horizontal distance i.e. the node which comes last for a particular value of horizontal distance. At level 2 node 2 is the last node with horizontal distance -1 so print it. Node 5  at level 3 is the bottom-most node with horizontal distance 0. At the same level 3 node 6 is the bottom-most node with horizontal distance 3. At last level 4 node 7 has horizontal distance 2 so we print it.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If one or more nodes have the same horizontal distance we consider the one&#8217;s which comes last during the level traversal.</p>\n<p><strong>For Example</strong> Node 1, Node 4 and Node 5 have same horizontal distance 0 but Node 5 comes later or last during level order traversal so we print node 5. Similar rule is followed for Node 3 and Node 7 having horizontal distance 2.</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">Input:                                                   hd=Horizontal distance\r\n                                                 \r\n hd=0              20                                    -- level 1\r\n                /       \\\r\n               /         \\\r\n hd= -1      10           30       -&gt;  hd= +1            -- level 2\r\n            /   \\        /   \\\r\n           /     \\      /     \\\r\n hd= -2   5      15    25      35  -&gt;  hd= +2            -- level 3 \r\n                hd=0   hd=0\r\n \r\n            // Tree is Viewed from the bottom here\r\n             \r\nOutput: 5  10  25  30  35</pre><p></p>\n<h2>Approach (Using Level Order Traversal and Hashing)</h2>\n<p>We follow these steps in order to implement this approach:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The idea is to put the nodes with same <strong>horizontal distance(hd)</strong> together and order them on basis of their hd.</li>\n<li>We insert tree nodes along with their respective <strong>hd</strong> in a Queue during level order traversal by maintaining a pair class NodeObj.</li>\n<li>To ensure we get the bottom-most node or last node, maintain a <strong>Tree-Map</strong> of key-value pair <strong>(hd, Node-data)</strong> sorted on key hd. We keep updating and replacing the map&#8217;s key hd with the current node data until we traverse all nodes.</li>\n<li>For the first time, it will add a node&#8217;s hd to the map with it&#8217;s data as value, next time it will replace the value if next node&#8217;s hd is same. At the end, this make sure that the bottom-most node for that horizontal distance is present in the map.</li>\n<li>Then we just iterate through the <strong>Tree-Map</strong> values which will contains our Top View.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> We do not store node as the value in the Map only the node data is sufficient.</p>\n<p>The Tree-Map for the above example looks like this:</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 27.4942%; height: 275px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 45.2%;\">        <strong>hd</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 54.8%;\">    <strong>Node-Data</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 45.2%;\">       -2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 54.8%;\">         5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 45.2%;\">       -1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 54.8%;\">        10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 45.2%;\">        0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 54.8%;\">        25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 45.2%;\">      +1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 54.8%;\">        30</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 45.2%;\">      +2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 54.8%;\">        35</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>So let&#8217;s look at the code of the above approach in Java.</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">import java.util.Queue;\r\nimport java.util.TreeMap;\r\nimport java.util.LinkedList;\r\nimport java.util.Map;\r\nimport java.util.Map.Entry;\r\n \r\n// class to create a node\r\nclass Node {\r\n    int data;\r\n    Node left, right;\r\n \r\n    public Node(int data) {\r\n        this.data = data;\r\n        left = null;\r\n        right = null;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n \r\nclass NodeObj            // Each Object holds the current node to add in Queue\r\n{\r\n            Node node;\r\n            int hd;

At level 2 node 2 is the topmost node with horizontal distance -1 so print it, at the same level 2 node 3 is the topmost node with horizontal distance 1. At level 3 node 6 is the topmost node with horizontal distance 2.</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">Input:     // Tree is Viewed from top here             hd=Horizontal distance\r\n   \r\n  hd=0             20                                   -- level 1\r\n                /       \\\r\n               /         \\\r\n  hd=-1       10          30         hd= +1             -- level 2\r\n            /   \\        /   \\\r\n           /     \\      /     \\\r\n  hd=-2   5      15    25      35    hd= +2             -- level 3 \r\n                hd=0   hd=0\r\n\r\nOutput: 5  10  20  30  35</pre><p></p>\n<h2>Approach (Using Level Order Traversal and <a href=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/2017/06/hashing.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hashing</a>)</h2>\n<p>The idea of our approach is to put nodes with same horizontal distance together. Then, print the topmost node with the respective horizontal distance. We get the topmost node by maintaining a map and doing level order traversal. At a particular level if the node with the given horizontal distance is not present in our map, we add the node&#8217;s <strong>hd </strong>as a key to our map and it&#8217;s data as the value. We maintain a pair class of node and hd to maintain each node&#8217;s hd and level in our Queue while processing them. We add a given hd only once which ensures only the topmost node is present in our map. Lastly, we print the values of the map. In order to print the top view from left to right we use a <strong>Tree Map</strong> to order the Map with respect to hd.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> We use the short form of horizontal distance of each node as hd.</p>\n<p>Below is the implementation in Java:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">import java.util.Queue;\r\nimport java.util.TreeMap;\r\nimport java.util.LinkedList;\r\nimport java.util.Map;\r\nimport java.util.Map.Entry;\r\n \r\n// class to create a node\r\nclass Node {\r\n    int data;\r\n    Node left, right;\r\n \r\n    public Node(int data) {\r\n        this.data = data;\r\n        left = null;\r\n        right = null;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass NodeObj    // Each Object holds the current node to add in Queue\r\n{\r\n            Node node;\r\n            int hd; // Horizontal Distance of each Node\r\n \r\n            NodeObj(Node node, int hd) \r\n            {\r\n                this.node = node;\r\n                this.hd = hd;\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n}\r\n \r\n// class of binary tree\r\npublic class Tree \r\n{\r\n    Node root;\r\n     \r\n    // method to print the topView of the binary tree\r\n    void TopView(Node root) \r\n    {\r\n        if (root == null)\r\n        return;   // There is no top view of of a tree having  root null \r\n        \r\n        Queue&lt;NodeObj&gt; queue = new LinkedList&lt;NodeObj&gt;();\r\n        // Declare Map to maintain hd and node data.\r\n        Map&lt;Integer,Integer&gt; topView = new TreeMap&lt;&gt;();\r\n \r\n        // We first add the root into the queue along with it's hd 0.\r\n        queue.add(new NodeObj(root, 0));\r\n \r\n         \r\n        // Standard level order traversal using Queue\r\n        while (!queue.isEmpty()) \r\n        {\r\n            NodeObj curr = queue.poll(); // we dequeue the curent NodeObj\r\n            Node tempNode=curr.node; // get the current node to process.\r\n            int hd=curr.hd;          // get the node's respective horizontal distance.\r\n            \r\n            // if our map does not contain the current node's hd we insert it.\r\n            if (!topView.containsKey(hd)) \r\n            {\r\n                topView.put(hd,tempNode.data);\r\n            }\r\n            \r\n            // Now add the left and right child of each node \r\n            // to continue level order traversal\r\n            \r\n            if (tempNode.left != null) \r\n            {\r\n                // hd of left child = hd of parent node - 1.\r\n                queue.add(new NodeObj(tempNode.left, hd - 1)); \r\n            }\r\n            \r\n            if (tempNode.right != null) \r\n            {\r\n                // hd of right child = hd of parent node + 1.\r\n                queue.add(new NodeObj(tempNode.right, hd + 1));\r\n            }\r\n \r\n        }\r\n        // We just print the values corresponding to each key(hd) or the nodes present in top view \r\n        for (Entry&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; entry : topView.entrySet()) {\r\n            System.out.print(entry.getValue()+\" \");\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n     \r\n    // Driver Code or Main method to test above functions\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) \r\n    { \r\n       \r\n        Tree tree = new Tree();\r\n        tree.root = new Node(20);\r\n        tree.root.left = new Node(10);\r\n        tree.root.left.left = new Node(5);\r\n        tree.root.left.right = new Node(15);\r\n        tree.root.right = new Node(30);\r\n        tree.root.right.left = new Node(25);\r\n        tree.root.right.right = new Node(35);\r\n        \r\n        System.out.println(\"The Top View of Binary Tree is: \");  \r\n        \r\n        tree.TopView(tree.root); \r\n    } \r\n     \r\n}</pre><p><strong>Output:</strong></p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">The Top View of Binary Tree is: \r\n5 10 20 30 35</pre><p><strong>Time Complexity: </strong>Now we analyze the time complexity of our approach.

If the current node&#8217;s level is greater than the max level we print it and update max level with the current node&#8217;s level.

At level 2 node 3 is the last node so print it, at level 3 node 6 and at the last level 4 node 7 is the only node.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If a level contains only one node then that node is a part of our Right View.</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">Input:\r\n                      15          --level 1\r\n                    /    \\\r\n                  10      35      --level 2\r\n                  /       / \\\r\n                 5       30  45   --level 3\r\n                        /\r\n                       20         --level 4\r\n\r\nOutput: 15  35  45  20</pre><p></p>\n<h2>Approach 1 (Recursive Approach)</h2>\n<p>We traverse the tree in a way that we keep track of current level by passing a max_level variable by reference to each recursive call or maintain a static variable so to keep track of the maximum level reached. When we process the current node we check if it&#8217;s level is more than max level till now. If current node&#8217;s level is greater than max_level we print it and update max level with current node&#8217;s level. Otherwise, we traverse for the <strong>Right Subtrees</strong> at first then the <strong>Left subtrees</strong>. Traversing Right subtrees first help us print the last node of each level.</p>\n<p>Below is the implementation of above in Java:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">// class to construct each node of tree\r\nclass Node \r\n{\r\n    int data;\r\n    Node left,right;\r\n \r\n    public Node(int data)\r\n    {\r\n        this.data=data;\r\n        left=null;\r\n        right=null;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n \r\n/* Class to print the Right view and construct Tree*/\r\nclass Tree \r\n{\r\n    Node root;\r\n    static int max_level = 0;\r\n \r\n    // recursive function to print Right view\r\n    void rightViewHelper(Node node, int current_level)\r\n    {\r\n        // Base Case\r\n        if (node == null)\r\n            return;\r\n \r\n        // If this is the last node of its level\r\n        if (max_level &lt; current_level) {\r\n            System.out.print(\" \" + node.data);\r\n            max_level = current_level;\r\n        }\r\n \r\n        // Recur for Right subtrees then left subtrees\r\n        rightViewHelper(node.right,current_level + 1);\r\n        rightViewHelper(node.left,current_level + 1);\r\n    }\r\n \r\n    // A wrapper over Helper Function\r\n    void rightView()\r\n    {\r\n        rightViewHelper(root, 1);\r\n    }\r\n \r\n    public static void main(String args[])\r\n    {\r\n        /* creating a binary tree and entering the nodes */\r\n        Tree tree = new Tree();\r\n        tree.root = new Node(15);\r\n        tree.root.left = new Node(10);\r\n        tree.root.left.left=new Node(5);\r\n        tree.root.right = new Node(35);\r\n        tree.root.right.left = new Node(30);\r\n        tree.root.right.left.left = new Node(20);\r\n        tree.root.right.right = new Node(45);\r\n \r\n        tree.rightView();\r\n    }\r\n}</pre><p><strong>Output:</strong></p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">15 35 45 20</pre><p><strong>Time Complexity: </strong>We do a traversal of all nodes in tree so the complexity is <strong>O (n).</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Space Complexity: </strong>We call the function <strong>rightViewHelper()</strong> for each node so if System stack space is considered the complexity is <strong>O (n)</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Approach 2 (Iterative Approach Using Queue)</h2>\n<p>We use <strong>Level Order Traversal</strong> technique.

It is a built in datatype used to store large textual data with variable length holding up to <strong>2,147,483,647 bytes of characters</strong> i.e. up to 2 GB long. It can store both single byte or multiple byte character streams. The CLOB datatype is represented using the <strong>java.sql.Clob</strong> interface in the JDBC API in Java. The CLOB object in JDBC holds a logical pointer to SQL CLOB.

We will also see the general syntax related to each of the commands and the corresponding queries to implement these commands in SQL.</p>\n<h3>DELETE</h3>\n<p>The SQL DELETE command is used to delete existing records or rows from a table. The query can be used to delete one or multiple records from an existing table depending on the condition specified. The DELETE command is a Data Manipulation Language (DML) command. This command returns the number of records deleted after execution. With this command, we can also delete all the records of the table if we do not specify the condition in the <strong>WHERE</strong> clause.</p>\n<p><strong>DELETE Command Syntax to REMOVE all Rows:</strong></p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">DELETE FROM Table_Name;</pre><p>This query deletes all records from the given table name.</p>\n<p><strong>DELETE Command Syntax with WHERE Clause:</strong></p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">DELETE FROM Table_Name WHERE [Conditions];</pre><p><strong>Note:</strong> We do not need to list fields or column names of the table because the entire row or tuple is deleted.</p>\n<p><strong>Example Queries:</strong></p>\n<p>This query removes all records or rows where Student_Id&gt;100 (Student_Id is a column or attribute of table Student)</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">DELETE FROM Student WHERE Student_Id&gt;100;</pre><p>This query deletes all rows from table Student as WHERE clause and the conditions are not specified.</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">DELETE FROM Student;</pre><p></p>\n<h2>DROP</h2>\n<p>The SQL DROP command is used to drop the whole table. In other words, it deletes the entire records as well as the schema and structure of the table along with its named elements. The DROP command is a Data Definition Language (DDL) command. In addition, this command can also be used to drop databases. Databases or tables once dropped are wiped out of existence and cannot be recovered.</p>\n<p><strong>DROP Command Syntax:</strong></p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">DROP TABLE Table_Name;</pre><p><strong>Example Queries:</strong></p>\n<p>This query will drop the table Student from the database</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">DROP TABLE Student;</pre><p>This query drops/deletes the entire Database School.</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">DROP DATABASE School;</pre><p></p>\n<h2>TRUNCATE</h2>\n<p>The SQL TRUNCATE command is used to delete all the records/rows from the table without affecting the schema and structure of the database. The TRUNCATE Command is a Data Definition Language (DDL) command. This command cannot be used to delete a single row in a database because the TRUNCATE command cannot use the WHERE clause.</p>\n<p><strong>TRUNCATE Command Syntax:</strong></p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">TRUNCATE TABLE Table_Name;</pre><p><strong>Example Queries:</strong></p>\n<p>This query removes all records from table Student.</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">TRUNCATE TABLE Student;</pre><p></p>\n<h2>Difference between DELETE, DROP and TRUNCATE</h2>\n<p>Now, we compare and contrast between key features of DELETE, DROP and TRUNCATE commands respectively.</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100.984%; height: 622px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 61px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 61px; text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 1.1em; font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;\">DELETE</span></strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 61px; text-align: center;\"><strong>DROP</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 34.3589%; height: 61px; text-align: center;\"><strong>TRUNCATE</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 62px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 62px;\">1.

The exam system allows to create complete exams with questions and its options. The exam access are given to users to complete exams in a given time. The system also allows its users to see  their exam result. </p>\n<p>The online exam systems are always in demand because most of exams or test are conducted online. So if you&#8217;re a developer and looking for solution to develop your online exam system then you&#8217;re here the right place. In this tutorial you will learn how to develop your own online exam system  with PHP and MySQL.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://webdamn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/online-exam-system-php-min.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1467\" height=\"845\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1904\" style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd;border-radius: 4px;padding: 5px; \" srcset=\"https://webdamn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/online-exam-system-php-min.png 1467w, https://webdamn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/online-exam-system-php-min-300x173.png 300w, https://webdamn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/online-exam-system-php-min-1024x590.png 1024w, https://webdamn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/online-exam-system-php-min-768x442.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1467px) 100vw, 1467px\" /><span id=\"more-1608\"></span></p>\n<p>Here we will develop a online exam system and cover following. </p>\n<p><strong>The Administrator can do the following:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add/Edit Exams with questions and options.</li>\n<li>Manage users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The users can do the following:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enroll to Exams.</li>\n<li>View Own Exams.</li>\n<li>Complete Exams.</li>\n<li>View Exam Results.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So let’s start developing  CRM system with PHP and MySQL. The major files are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>user.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>exam.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>enroll.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>questions.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>view.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>process_exam.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>User.php</strong>: A class contains users methods.</li>\n<li><strong>Exam.php</strong>: A class contains methods related to exams.</li>\n<li><strong>Questions.php</strong>: A class contains methods related to questions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Step1: Create MySQL Database Table</h2>\n<p>First we will create MySQL database tables for our online exam system. The major tables are following.</p>\n<p>We will create <code>online_exam_user</code> table to store users information.</p>\n<pre>\r\nCREATE TABLE `online_exam_user` (\r\n  `id` int(11) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,\r\n  `first_name` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,\r\n  `last_name` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,\r\n  `gender` enum('Male','Female') NOT NULL,\r\n  `email` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,\r\n  `password` varchar(64) NOT NULL,\r\n  `mobile` varchar(12) NOT NULL,\r\n  `address` text NOT NULL,\r\n  `created` datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT current_timestamp(),  \r\n  `role` enum('user','admin') NOT NULL\r\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;\r\n</pre>\n<p>We will create <code>online_exam_exams</code> table to store exams information.</p>\n<pre>\r\nCREATE TABLE `online_exam_exams` (\r\n  `id` int(11) NOT NULL,\r\n  `user_id` int(11) NOT NULL,\r\n  `exam_title` varchar(250) NOT NULL,\r\n  `exam_datetime` datetime NOT NULL,\r\n  `duration` varchar(30) NOT NULL,\r\n  `total_question` int(5) NOT NULL,\r\n  `marks_per_right_answer` varchar(30) NOT NULL,\r\n  `marks_per_wrong_answer` varchar(30) NOT NULL,\r\n  `created_on` datetime NOT NULL,\r\n  `status` enum('Pending','Created','Started','Completed') NOT NULL,\r\n  `exam_code` varchar(100) NOT NULL\r\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;\r\n</pre>\n<p>We will create <code>online_exam_question</code> table to store exams questions information.</p>\n<pre>\r\nCREATE TABLE `online_exam_question` (\r\n  `id` int(11) NOT NULL,\r\n  `exam_id` int(11) NOT NULL,\r\n  `question` text NOT NULL,\r\n  `answer` enum('1','2','3','4') NOT NULL\r\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;\r\n</pre>\n<p>We will create <code>online_exam_option</code> table to store questions options information.</p>\n<pre>\r\nCREATE TABLE `online_exam_option` (\r\n  `id` int(11) NOT NULL,\r\n  `question_id` int(11) NOT NULL,\r\n  `option` int(2) NOT NULL,\r\n  `title` varchar(250) NOT NULL\r\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;\r\n</pre>\n<p>and we will create <code>online_exam_question_answer</code> table to store exam questions answer information.</p>\n<pre>\r\nCREATE TABLE `online_exam_question_answer` (\r\n  `id` int(11) NOT NULL,\r\n  `user_id` int(11) NOT NULL,\r\n  `exam_id` int(11) NOT NULL,\r\n  `question_id` int(11) NOT NULL,\r\n  `user_answer_option` enum('0','1','2','3','4') NOT NULL,\r\n  `marks` varchar(20) NOT NULL\r\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;\r\n</pre>\n<h2>Step2: Manage Exam Section</h2>\n<p>We will implement functionality in <code>exam.php</code> file to manage exams.

So if you&#8217;re developer and thinking about to develop a CRM system, then you&#8217;re here at the right place. In this tutorial you will learn how to develop CRM system with PHP and MySQL.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://webdamn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/crm-system-min.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1435\" height=\"651\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1878\" srcset=\"https://webdamn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/crm-system-min.png 1435w, https://webdamn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/crm-system-min-300x136.png 300w, https://webdamn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/crm-system-min-1024x465.png 1024w, https://webdamn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/crm-system-min-768x348.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1435px) 100vw, 1435px\" /><br />\n<span id=\"more-1542\"></span></p>\n<p>In this tutorial, we will implement CRM system for sales people to track customers. We will developer Sales Manager section and Sales People section to build the system. We will cover following in this tutorial.</p>\n<p><strong>The Sales Manager will be able to do following:</strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Manage customers</li>\n<li>Manage sales team</li>\n<li>View sales activities</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The Sales People will be able to do following:</strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Access tasks</li>\n<li>View leads</li>\n<li>Create new tasks for each lead</li>\n<li>Create new opportunity</li>\n<li>Close a sale</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So let’s start developing  CRM system with PHP and MySQL. The major files are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>index.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>sales_people.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>tasks.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>contact.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>leads.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>opportunity.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>User.php</strong>: A class contains users methods.</li>\n<li><strong>Leads.php</strong>: A class contains leads methods.</li>\n<li><strong>Tasks.php</strong>: A class contains tasks methods.</li>\n<li><strong>Opportunity.php</strong>: A class contains sales oppotunity methods.</li>\n<li><strong>Customer.php</strong>: A class contains customer methods.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Step1: Create MySQL Database Table</h2>\n<p>First we will create MySQL database tables for our system. The major tables are following.</p>\n<p>We will create <code>crm_users</code> table to store users details.</p>\n<pre>\r\nCREATE TABLE `crm_users` (\r\n  `id` int(11) NOT NULL,\r\n  `name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,\r\n  `email` varchar(50) NOT NULL,\r\n  `password` varchar(50) NOT NULL,\r\n  `roles` enum('manager','sales') NOT NULL,\r\n  `status` int(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0\r\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;\r\n</pre>\n<p>We will create <code>crm_contact</code> table to store conact details.</p>\n<pre>\r\nCREATE TABLE `crm_contact` (\r\n  `id` int(11) NOT NULL,\r\n  `contact_title` varchar(255) NOT NULL,\r\n  `contact_first` varchar(255) NOT NULL,\r\n  `contact_middle` varchar(255) NOT NULL,\r\n  `contact_last` varchar(255) NOT NULL,\r\n  `initial_contact_date` datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT current_timestamp(),\r\n  `title` varchar(255) NOT NULL,\r\n  `company` varchar(255) NOT NULL,\r\n  `industry` varchar(255) NOT NULL,\r\n  `address` text NOT NULL,\r\n  `city` varchar(255) NOT NULL,\r\n  `state` varchar(255) NOT NULL,\r\n  `country` varchar(255) NOT NULL,\r\n  `zip` int(11) NOT NULL,\r\n  `phone` int(11) NOT NULL,\r\n  `email` varchar(50) NOT NULL,\r\n  `status` enum('Lead','Proposal','Customer / won','Archive') NOT NULL,\r\n  `website` varchar(255) NOT NULL,\r\n  `sales_rep` int(11) NOT NULL,\r\n  `project_type` varchar(255) NOT NULL,\r\n  `project_description` text NOT NULL,\r\n  `proposal_due_date` varchar(255) NOT NULL,\r\n  `budget` int(11) NOT NULL,\r\n  `deliverables` varchar(255) NOT NULL\r\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;\r\n</pre>\n<p>and we will create <code>crm_tasks</code> table to store tasks details.</p>\n<pre>\r\nCREATE TABLE `crm_tasks` (\r\n  `id` int(11) NOT NULL,\r\n  `created` datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT current_timestamp(),\r\n  `task_type` varchar(255) NOT NULL,\r\n  `task_description` text NOT NULL,\r\n  `task_due_date` varchar(255) NOT NULL,\r\n  `task_status` enum('Pending','Completed') NOT NULL,\r\n  `task_update` varchar(255) NOT NULL,\r\n  `contact` int(11) NOT NULL,\r\n  `sales_rep` int(11) NOT NULL\r\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;\r\n</pre>\n<h2>Step2: Implement User Login and Access</h2>\n<p>We will implement the user login for sales manager and sales people to access related section to manage system. So we will create login form in <code>index.php</code> file.</p>\n<pre>\r\n&#60;form id=\"loginform\" class=\"form-horizontal\" role=\"form\" method=\"POST\" action=\"\"&#62;                                    \r\n\t&#60;div style=\"margin-bottom: 25px\" class=\"input-group\"&#62;\r\n\t\t&#60;span class=\"input-group-addon\"&#62;&#60;i class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-user\"&#62;&#60;/i&#62;&#60;/span&#62;\r\n\t\t&#60;input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\" value=\"&#60;?php if(!empty($_POST[\"email\"])) { echo $_POST[\"email\"]; } ?&#62;\" placeholder=\"email\" style=\"background:white;\" required&#62;                                        \r\n\t&#60;/div&#62;                                \r\n\t&#60;div style=\"margin-bottom: 25px\" class=\"input-group\"&#62;\r\n\t\t&#60;span class=\"input-group-addon\"&#62;&#60;i class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-lock\"&#62;&#60;/i&#62;&#60;/span&#62;\r\n\t\t&#60;input type=\"password\" class=\"form-control\" id=\"password\" name=\"password\" value=\"&#60;?php if(!empty($_POST[\"password\"])) { echo $_POST[\"password\"]; } ?&#62;\" placeholder=\"password\" required&#62;\r\n\t&#60;/div&#62;\t\r\n\r\n\t&#60;label class=\"radio-inline\"&#62;\r\n\t  &#60;input type=\"radio\" name=\"loginType\" value=\"manager\"&#62;Sales Manager\r\n\t&#60;/label&#62;\r\n\t&#60;label class=\"radio-inline\"&#62;\r\n\t  &#60;input type=\"radio\" name=\"loginType\" value=\"sales\"&#62;Sales People\r\n\t&#60;/label&#62;\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t&#60;div style=\"margin-top:10px\" class=\"form-group\"&#62;                               \r\n\t\t&#60;div class=\"col-sm-12 controls\"&#62;\r\n\t\t  &#60;input type=\"submit\" name=\"login\" value=\"Login\" class=\"btn btn-info\"&#62;\t\t\t\t\t\t  \r\n\t\t&#60;/div&#62;\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t&#60;/div&#62;\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n&#60;/form&#62;\r\n</pre>\n<p>Then we will implement login functionality by calling method <code>login()</code> from class <code>User.php</code>.</p>\n<pre>\r\npublic function login(){\r\n\tif($this->email && $this->password) {\t\t\t\r\n\t\t$sqlQuery = \"\r\n\t\t\tSELECT * FROM \".$this->userTable.\"\r\n\t\t\tWHERE status = 1 \r\n\t\t\tAND roles = ?

Usually, one sales representative has many contacts. So here we will manage the contact. In <code>contact.php</code> file, we will display the list of contact. </p>\n<pre>\r\n&#60;table id=\"contactListing\" class=\"table table-bordered table-striped\"&#62;\r\n\t&#60;thead&#62;\r\n\t\t&#60;tr&#62;\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t&#60;th&#62;Id&#60;/th&#62;\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t&#60;th&#62;Name&#60;/th&#62;\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t&#60;th&#62;Company&#60;/th&#62;\r\n\t\t\t&#60;th&#62;Industry&#60;/th&#62;\r\n\t\t\t&#60;th&#62;Budget&#60;/th&#62;\r\n\t\t\t&#60;th&#62;Sales Rep&#60;/th&#62;\r\n\t\t\t&#60;th&#62;&#60;/th&#62;\t\r\n\t\t\t&#60;th&#62;&#60;/th&#62;\t\r\n\t\t\t&#60;th&#62;&#60;/th&#62;\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t&#60;/tr&#62;\r\n\t&#60;/thead&#62;\r\n&#60;/table&#62;\r\n</pre>\n<p>We will make ajax request to load contact list with action <code>listContact</code> to action <code>contact_action.php</code>.</p>\n<pre>\r\nvar contactRecords = $('#contactListing').DataTable({\r\n\t\"lengthChange\": false,\r\n\t\"processing\":true,\r\n\t\"serverSide\":true,\t\t\r\n\t\"bFilter\": false,\r\n\t'serverMethod': 'post',\t\t\r\n\t\"order\":[],\r\n\t\"ajax\":{\r\n\t\turl:\"contact_action.php\",\r\n\t\ttype:\"POST\",\r\n\t\tdata:{action:'listContact'},\r\n\t\tdataType:\"json\"\r\n\t},\r\n\t\"columnDefs\":[\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"targets\":[0, 6, 7, 8],\r\n\t\t\t\"orderable\":false,\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t],\r\n\t\"pageLength\": 10\r\n});\t\r\n</pre>\n<p>In <code>contact_action.php</code> on action <code>listContact</code>, we will call method <code>listContact()</code> from class <code>Contact.php</code>.</p>\n<pre>\r\n$contact = new Contact($db);\r\n\r\nif(!empty($_POST['action']) && $_POST['action'] == 'listContact') {\r\n\t$contact->listContact();\r\n}\r\n</pre>\n<p>Now wwe will implement the method <code>listContact()</code> in class <code>Contact.php</code></p>\n<pre>\r\npublic function listContact(){\r\n\t\t\r\n\t$sqlWhere = '';\r\n\tif($_SESSION[\"role\"] == 'sales') { \r\n\t\t$sqlWhere = \" WHERE c.sales_rep = '\".$_SESSION[\"userid\"].\"'\";\r\n\t}\t\r\n\t\r\n\t$sqlQuery = \"SELECT c.id, c.contact_first, c.company, c.industry, c.budget, u.name \r\n\tFROM \".$this-&#62;contactTable.\" c\r\n\tLEFT JOIN \".$this-&#62;userTable.\" u ON c.sales_rep = u.id $sqlWhere\";\r\n\t\r\n\tif(!empty($_POST[\"order\"])){\r\n\t\t$sqlQuery .= ' ORDER BY '.$_POST['order']['0']['column'].'

Before we begin, take a look on files structure for this example.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>index.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>School.php</strong>: A class to hold school methods.</li>\n<li><strong>dashboard.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>students.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>teacher.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>classes.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>subjects.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>sections.php</strong></li>\n<li><strong>attendance.php</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Step1: Create MySQL Database Table</h3>\n<p>First we will MySQL database tables <strong>sms_user</strong>, <strong>sms_teacher</strong>, <strong>sms_students</strong>, <strong>sms_classes</strong>, <strong>sms_subjects</strong>, <strong>sms_section</strong> and <strong>sms_attendance</strong>. All the tables structure and data is available in project download zip file.</p>\n<h3>Step2: Create User Login</h3>\n<p>In <strong>index.php</strong> file, we will create login form to implement admin login to allow access to logged in user only.</p>\n<pre>\r\n&#60;div class=\"container\"&#62;\t\t\r\n\t&#60;div class=\"col-md-6\"&#62;

In this tutorial we will explain how to work with regular expressions in Golang.</p>\n<p>A regular expression or regex is a sequence of characters to define a search pattern. It&#8217;a powerful technique used in most of programming language. Instead of writing many code lines, regex provides fast solution to handle everything in a single line of code to search, replace, extract, pattern matching etc. <span id=\"more-1855\"></span></p>\n<p>In Golang, there are built-in package <code>regexp</code> for regular expressions. The package uses RE2 syntax standards that is also used by other languages like Python, C, and Perl. The package contains functions to deal with regular expressions. The major regex functions are <code>MatchString()</code>, <code>FindString()</code>, <code>FindStringIndex()</code>, <code>FindStringSubmatch()</code>, <code>FindStringSubmatchIndex()</code>, <code>Compile()</code>, <code>MustCompile()</code> and more.</p>\n<p>So here in this tutorial, we will explain regex functions with examples to work with regular expressions. </p>\n<h2>1. MatchString Method</h2>\n<p>We can use the method <code>regexp.MatchString()</code> from regex package for matching substring. Here in below example code, we want test if string starts with <strong>G</strong> character. We will use caret(^) to match the beginning of a text in a string. so we will use substring as &#8220;^G&#8221; to match in a string.</p>\n<pre>\r\npackage main \r\n  \r\nimport ( \r\n    \"fmt\"\r\n    \"regexp\"\r\n) \r\n  \r\nfunc main() {   \r\n    \r\n    str := \"Golang regular expressions example\" \r\n    \r\n    match, err := regexp.MatchString(`^G`, str) \t\r\n    fmt.Println(\"Match: \", match, \" Error: \", err) \r\n    \r\n} \r\n</pre>\n<p>when we run the above example code, it will match the substring and return true. So it will display the output like below:</p>\n<pre>\r\nMatch:  true  Error:  &#60;nil&#62;\r\n</pre>\n<h2>2. Compile or MustCompile method</h2>\n<p>We can use the <code>Compile()</code> or <code>MustCompile()</code> method to create the object of regex. The <code>Compile()</code> method return error if there regular expression is invalid while <code>MustCompile()</code> run without any error when there are invalid regular expression. So its always recommended to use <code>Compile()</code> to create regex object. We can use these like below.</p>\n<pre>\r\nregexp1, err := regexp.Compile(`regexp`)\r\n\t\r\nregexp2 := regexp.MustCompile(`regexp`)\r\n</pre>\n<h2>3. FindString method</h2>\n<p>We can use the <code>FindString()</code> method to get the result of the first match. If there are no match, the return value is an empty string. Here in below example code, we will match the text <strong>ple</strong> to exit at end of string. If string match then it will return the match otherwise return empty string. In this example code, we have also used method <code>Compile()</code> to create a Regexp object. If we don&#8217;t want to get an error, we can use <code>MustCompile()</code> method for the same.  </p>\n<pre>\r\npackage main \r\n  \r\nimport ( \r\n    \"fmt\"\r\n    \"regexp\"\r\n) \r\n  \r\nfunc main() {   \r\n    \r\n    str := \"Golang regular expressions example\" \r\n    \r\n    regexp := regexp.Compile(\"ple$\")\r\n  \r\n    fmt.Println(regexp.FindString(str))\t\r\n    \r\n} \r\n</pre>\n<p>when we run the above code, it display the following match string.</p>\n<pre>\r\nMatch:  ple  Error:  &#60;nil&#62;\r\n</pre>\n<h2>4. FindStringIndex method</h2>\n<p>We can use the method <code>FindStringIndex()</code> to get the the starting and ending index of the leftmost match of the regular expression. If there no match then it will return null value.</p>\n<p>In below example code, we will find index of text <strong>p</strong> in a string.</p>\n<pre>\r\npackage main \r\n  \r\nimport ( \r\n    \"fmt\"\r\n    \"regexp\"\r\n) \r\n  \r\nfunc main() {   \r\n    \r\n    str := \"Golang regular expressions example\" \r\n    \r\n    regexp, err := regexp.Compile(`p`)\r\n\t\r\n\tmatch := regexp.FindStringIndex(str)\r\n\t\r\n\tfmt.Println(\"Match: \", match, \" Error: \", err) \r\n    \r\n} \r\n</pre>\n<p>when we will run above example code, it will return following output.</p>\n<pre>\r\nMatch:  [17 18]  Error:  &#60;nil&#62;\r\n</pre>\n<h2>5. FindStringSubmatch method</h2>\n<p>We can use the method <code>FindStringSubmatch()</code> to find the leftmost substring that matches the regex pattern. If there are no match  then it will return a null value.</p>\n<pre>\r\npackage main \r\n  \r\nimport ( \r\n    \"fmt\"\r\n    \"regexp\"\r\n) \r\n  \r\nfunc main() {   \r\n    \r\n    str := \"Golang regular expressions example\" \r\n    \r\n    regexp, err := regexp.Compile(`l([a-z]+)g`)\r\n\t\r\n\tmatch := regexp.FindStringSubmatch(str)\r\n\t\r\n\tfmt.Println(\"Match: \", match, \" Error: \", err) \r\n    \r\n}\r\n</pre>\n<p>when we run above example code, it will return following result with leftmost substring from match.</p>\n<pre>\r\nMatch:  [lang an]  Error:   &#60;nil&#62;\r\n</pre>\n<h2>6. FindStringSubmatchIndex Method</h2>\n<p>We can use the method <code>FindStringSubmatchIndex()</code> to find index of leftmost substring that matches the regex pattern.</p>\n<pre>\r\npackage main \r\n  \r\nimport ( \r\n    \"fmt\"\r\n    \"regexp\"\r\n) \r\n  \r\nfunc main() {   \r\n    \r\n    str := \"Golang regular expressions example\" \r\n    \r\n    regexp, err := regexp.Compile(`l([a-z]+)g`)\r\n\t\r\n\tmatch := regexp.FindStringSubmatchIndex(str)\r\n\t\r\n\tfmt.Println(\"Match: \", match, \" Error: \", err) \r\n    \r\n} \r\n</pre>\n<p>when we run above example code, it will return following result with index from leftmost substring from match.</p>\n<pre>\r\nMatch:  [2 6 3 5]  Error:  &#60;nil&#62;\r\n</pre>The post <a href=\"https://webdamn.com/regular-expressions-in-golang/\">Regular Expressions in Golang</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://webdamn.com\">WD</a>.]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://webdamn.com/regular-expressions-in-golang/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Creating REST API with Golang</title>\n\t\t<link>https://webdamn.com/creating-rest-api-with-golang/</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<comments>https://webdamn.com/creating-rest-api-with-golang/#respond</comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[webdamn]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 13:11:03 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Golang Tutorials]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tutorials]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://webdamn.com/?p=1633</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>In our previous tutorial, we have explained how to Delete Files in Golang.

In this tutorial we will explain how to create <strong>REST API in Golang</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>REST (Representational State Transfer)</strong> is the most used interface to populate the dynamic data and perform operations such as add, update and delete in web applications. The REST APIs are used in all kinds applications to make <strong>GET, POST, PUT or DELETE HTTP</strong> requests to perform CRUD operations on data.</p>\n<p>In this tutorial, we are going to explain to create simple <strong>REST API with Golang</strong> to perform GET, POST, DELETE and PUT on dynamic data. We will mainly focus on the basic concepts of this, so we will perform actions on employee JSON data instead of database. So you can use this by connection with database as per your application requirement.   <span id=\"more-1633\"></span></p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s proceed with coding to create REST API in Golang:</p>\n<h2>1. Create Server to Handle API Requests</h2>\n<p>We need to create server to handle HTTP requests to the API. So we will create a function <code>apiRequests()</code> in <code>main.go</code> file and called within <code>func main()</code>. The function <code>apiRequests()</code> will handle all requests to the root URL. </p>\n<pre>\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport (\r\n    \"fmt\"\r\n    \"log\"\r\n    \"net/http\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nfunc homePage(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request){\r\n    fmt.Fprintf(w, \"Welcome to the API Home page!\")    \r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc apiRequests() {\r\n    http.HandleFunc(\"/\", homePage)\r\n    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(\":3000\", nil))\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n    apiRequests()\r\n}\r\n</pre>\n<p>When we run the above code, the API will start on post 3000. The URL <code>http://localhost:3000/</code> will be loaded on browser and see the API home page welcome message and it means we have created the base of our REST API.</p>\n<h2>2. Create Employee Dummy Data for REST API</h2>\n<p>In this tutorial we will create simple REST API to perform CRUD operations <code> GET, POST, DELETE and PUT</code> employee data. We will create some dummy employee data in <code>func main()</code>. We will perform </p>\n<pre>\r\nfunc main() {\r\n\tEmployees = []Employee{\r\n\t\tEmployee{Id: \"1\", Name: \"Jhon Smith\", Address: \"New Jersy USA\", Salary: \"20000\"},\r\n\t\tEmployee{Id: \"2\", Name: \"William\", Address: \"Wellington Newziland\", Salary: \"12000\"},\r\n\t\tEmployee{Id: \"3\", Name: \"Adam\", Address: \"London England\", Salary: \"15000\"},\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n</pre>\n<h2>3. Get All Employee</h2>\n<p>Now we will start implementing our REST API methods. We will implement function <code>getAllEmployees()</code> to get all employee data.</p>\n<pre>\r\nfunc getAllEmployees(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {    \r\n    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(Employees)\r\n}\r\n</pre>\n<p>We will also handle routing and call function <code>getAllEmployees()</code> on action <code>employees</code> to get all employee in JSON format. We will use <code>gorilla/mux</code> based HTTP router in place of the standard library and use in this tutorial example.</p>\n<pre>\r\nfunc apiRequests() {\r\n    route := mux.NewRouter().StrictSlash(true)    \r\n    route.HandleFunc(\"/employees\", getAllEmployees)   \r\n    log.Fatal(route.ListenAndServe(\":3000\", route))\r\n}\r\n</pre>\n<p>When we load URL <code>http://localhost:3000/employees</code> on method <code>GET</code> then it will display all employee in JSON format.</p>\n<pre>\r\n{\"Id\":\"1\",\"Name\":\"Jhon Smith\",\"Address\":\"New Jersy USA\",\"Salary\":\"20000\"},\r\n{\"Id\":\"2\",\"Name\":\"William\",\"Address\":\"Wellington Newziland\",\"Salary\":\"12000\"},\r\n{\"Id\":\"3\",\"Name\":\"Adam\",\"Address\":\"London England\",\"Salary\":\"15000\"}\r\n</pre>\n<p>We can also get the specific employee record by passing employee id. For this we will create function <code>getEmployee()</code> to get employee data.</p>\n<pre>\r\nfunc getEmployee(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\r\n    vars := mux.Vars(r)\r\n    key := vars[\"id\"]\r\n    for _, employee := range Employees {\r\n        if employee.Id == key {\r\n            json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(employee)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n</pre>\n<p>we will call function <code>getEmployee()</code> on route <code>/employee/{id}</code> to get the employee  by id.</p>\n<pre>\r\nfunc apiRequests() {\r\n    route := mux.NewRouter().StrictSlash(true)\r\n    route.HandleFunc(\"/employee/{id}\", getEmployee)\r\n    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(\":3000\", route))\r\n}\r\n</pre>\n<p>When we load URL <code>http://localhost:3000/employee/3</code> then it will display employee by that id in JSON format.</p>\n<pre>\r\n{\"Id\":\"3\",\"Name\":\"Adam\",\"Address\":\"London England\",\"Salary\":\"15000\"}\r\n</pre>\n<h2>4. Create Employee Record</h2>\n<p>We will implement functionality to create a new employee record. We will create function <code>createEmployee()</code> to add a new employee record.</p>\n<pre>\r\nfunc createEmployee(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {        \r\n    reqBody, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(r.Body)\r\n    var employee Employee \r\n    json.Unmarshal(reqBody, &employee)    \r\n    Employees = append(Employees, employee)\r\n    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(employee)\r\n}\r\n</pre>\n<p>We will call function <code>createEmployee()</code> on method <code>POST</code> and route <code>employee</code> to post employee details to add a new record.</p>\n<pre>\r\nfunc apiRequests() {    \r\n    route.HandleFunc(\"/employee\", createEmployee).Methods(\"POST\")   \r\n    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(\":3000\", route))\r\n}\r\n</pre>\n<p>When we run our API and <code>POST</code> with following post body then it will create a new employee record.  </p>\n<pre>\r\n{\r\n    \"Id\": \"4\", \r\n    \"Name\": \"Peter\", \r\n    \"Address\": \"London, UK\", \r\n    \"Salary\": \"40000\" \r\n}\r\n</pre>\n<p>When we access URL with employee id 4 like <code>http://localhost:3000/employee/4</code> then it will display employee by that id in JSON format.</p>\n<pre>\r\n{\"Id\":\"4\",\"Name\":\"Peter\",\"Address\":\"London, UK\",\"Salary\":\"40000\"}\r\n</pre>\n<h2>5. Delete Employee Record</h2>\n<p>We will implement employee delete functionality by creating function <code>deleteEmployee()</code> to delete employee by id.</p>\n<pre>\r\nfunc deleteEmployee(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\r\n    vars := mux.Vars(r)\r\n    id := vars[\"id\"]\r\n    for index, employee := range Employees {\r\n        if employee.Id == id {\r\n            Employees = append(Employees[:index], Employees[index+1:]...)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n</pre>\n<p>We will call  function <code>deleteEmployee()</code> on route <code>/employee/{id}</code> to delete employee.</p>\n<pre>\r\nfunc apiRequests() {\r\n    route := mux.NewRouter().StrictSlash(true)    \r\n    route.HandleFunc(\"/employee/{id}\", deleteEmployee).Methods(\"DELETE\")  \r\n    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(\":3000\", route))\r\n}\r\n</pre>\n<p>When we will make HTTP request with method <code>DELETE</code> to URL <code>http://localhost:3000/employee/3</code> with employee id. It will delete that employee.</p>\n<h2>6. Complete REST API Code</h2>\n<p>Here is the complete running code for this example.</p>\n<pre>\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport (\r\n    \"encoding/json\"\r\n    \"fmt\"\r\n    \"log\"\r\n    \"io/ioutil\"\r\n    \"net/http\"\r\n\r\n    \"github.com/gorilla/mux\"\r\n)\r\n\r\ntype Employee struct {\r\n    Id      string    `json:\"Id\"`\r\n    Name    string `json:\"Name\"`\r\n    Address string `json:\"Address\"`\r\n    Salary  string `json:\"Salary\"`\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar Employees []Employee\r\n\r\nfunc homePage(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\r\n    fmt.Fprintf(w, \"Welcome to the API Home page!\")    \r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc getAllEmployees(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {    \r\n    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(Employees)\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc getEmployee(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\r\n    vars := mux.Vars(r)\r\n    key := vars[\"id\"]\r\n    for _, employee := range Employees {\r\n        if employee.Id == key {\r\n            json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(employee)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nfunc createEmployee(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {        \r\n    reqBody, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(r.Body)\r\n    var employee Employee \r\n    json.Unmarshal(reqBody, &employee)    \r\n    Employees = append(Employees, employee)\r\n    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(employee)\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc deleteEmployee(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\r\n    vars := mux.Vars(r)\r\n    id := vars[\"id\"]\r\n    for index, employee := range Employees {\r\n        if employee.Id == id {\r\n            Employees = append(Employees[:index], Employees[index+1:]...)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc apiRequests() {\r\n    route := mux.NewRouter().StrictSlash(true)\r\n    route.HandleFunc(\"/\", homePage)\r\n    route.HandleFunc(\"/employees\", getAllEmployees)\r\n    route.HandleFunc(\"/employee\", createEmployee).Methods(\"POST\")\r\n    route.HandleFunc(\"/employee/{id}\", deleteEmployee).Methods(\"DELETE\")\r\n    route.HandleFunc(\"/employee/{id}\", getEmployee)\r\n    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(\":3000\", route))\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n    Employees = []Employee{\r\n        Employee{Id: \"1\", Name: \"Jhon Smith\", Address: \"New Jersy USA\", Salary: \"20000\"},\r\n        Employee{Id: \"2\", Name: \"William\", Address: \"Wellington Newziland\", Salary: \"12000\"},\r\n\t\tEmployee{Id: \"3\", Name: \"Adam\", Address: \"London England\", Salary: \"15000\"},\r\n    }\r\n    apiRequests()\r\n}\r\n</pre>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Here in this tutorial, we have implemented HTTP methods <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code> and <code>DELETE</code> to read, add and delete employee data. We have not implemented <code>PUT</code> method to update employee data.

In this tutorial we will explain how to <strong>Delete Files in Golang</strong>.</p>\n<p>While working with files and directories, sometimes we need to delete specific file or all files from a directory. It&#8217;s very easy in Golang to delete a file. There are a <code>Remove()</code> and <code>RemoveAll()</code> method from <code>os</code> package in Golang to delete the files from a directory. <span id=\"more-1828\"></span></p>\n<p>In this tutorial, we will explain how to delete a specific file from a directory and also delete all files from a directory using Golang.</p>\n<h2>Deleting Specific File</h2>\n<p>We can use the method <code>Remove()</code> to delete files from a directory. Here in below example code we will pass file path to delete file.</p>\n<pre>\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport (\r\n    \"fmt\"\r\n    \"os\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n    \r\n    file := \"C:/Go/bin/file/files/IMG_4322.jpg\"\r\n    \r\n    if err != nil {\r\n        fmt.Println(err)\r\n        return\r\n    }\r\n    fmt.Println(\"File delete successfully.\")\r\n\t   \r\n}\r\n</pre>\n<h2>Deleting All Files from Directory</h2>\n<p>We will delete all files by reading all files from a directory. Here we will open the directory with <code>os.Open()</code> method and then read directory using <code>Readdir</code> method. Then we will loop through all files and delete one by one using <code>os.Remove()</code> method.</p>\n<pre>\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport (\r\n    \"fmt\"\r\n    \"os\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n    \r\n    directory := \"C:/Go/bin/file/files/\"\r\n    \r\n    readDirectory, _ := os.Open(directory)\r\n    allFiles, _ := readDirectory.Readdir(0)\r\n    \r\n    for f := range(allFiles) {\r\n        file := allFiles[f]\r\n\r\n        fileName := file.Name()\r\n        filePath := directory + fileName\r\n        \r\n        os.Remove(filePath)\r\n        fmt.Println(\"Deleted file:\", filePath)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n</pre>\n<p>The above example code will delete all files with following messages:</p>\n<pre>\r\nDeleted file: C:/Go/bin/file/files/IMG_4322.jpg\r\nDeleted file: C:/Go/bin/file/files/IMG_4323.jpg\r\nDeleted file: C:/Go/bin/file/files/IMG_4324.jpg\r\nDeleted file: C:/Go/bin/file/files/IMG_4325.jpg\r\n</pre>\n<p>We can also delete all files from a directory using <code>os.RemoveAll()</code> default method. Here is the complete code to delete all files using <code>os.RemoveAll()</code> method. </p>\n<pre>\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport (\r\n    \"fmt\"\r\n    \"os\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n    \r\n    directory := \"C:/Go/bin/file/files/\"\r\n    \r\n    err := os.RemoveAll(directory) \r\n    if err != nil {\r\n        fmt.Println(err)\r\n        return\r\n    }\r\n    fmt.Println(\"All files deleted from directory.\")\r\n}\r\n</pre>The post <a href=\"https://webdamn.com/how-to-delete-files-in-golang/\">How to Delete Files in Golang</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://webdamn.com\">WD</a>.]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://webdamn.com/how-to-delete-files-in-golang/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>\n"},"redirectURL":"","headersSize":-1,"bodySize":185578},"cache":{},"timings":{"blocked":-1,"dns":-1,"connect":-1,"ssl":-1,"send":1.2339999973773956,"wait":411.48310001194477,"receive":226.88929998874664}},{"pageref":"Embarcadero","startedDateTime":"2021-02-23T16:57:22.648-07:00","time":327.8409999907017,"request":{"method":"GET","url":"https://www.technologyreview.com/feed/","httpVersion":"HTTP/1.1","cookies":[],"headers":[{"name":"connection","value":"Keep-Alive"},{"name":"cookie","value":"__cfruid=c380f2086cca5447b9e1d48d14751967180543aa-1614124635; uid=lo_1fc4bf97e9f9; __cfduid=d47d2779bf39e49c3c7af6c553cc1dede1614124629"},{"name":"user-agent","value":"Embarcadero URI Client/1.0"},{"name":"host","value":"www.technologyreview.com"}],"queryString":[],"headersSize":-1,"bodySize":0},"response":{"status":200,"statusText":"OK","httpVersion":"HTTP/1.1","cookies":[],"headers":[{"name":"server","value":"nginx"},{"name":"date","value":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 23:57:21 GMT"},{"name":"content-type","value":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8"},{"name":"transfer-encoding","value":"chunked"},{"name":"connection","value":"keep-alive"},{"name":"x-powered-by","value":"WordPress VIP <https://wpvip.com>"},{"name":"last-modified","value":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 21:48:02 GMT"},{"name":"etag","value":"W/\"ce0104f1977830a404636a829a644153\""},{"name":"x-hacker","value":"If you're reading this, you should visit wpvip.com/careers and apply to join the fun, mention this header."},{"name":"host-header","value":"a9130478a60e5f9135f765b23f26593b"},{"name":"link","value":"<https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-json/>; rel=\"https://api.w.org/\""},{"name":"cache-control","value":"max-age=300, must-revalidate"},{"name":"accept-ranges","value":"bytes"},{"name":"strict-transport-security","value":"max-age=31536000;includeSubdomains;preload"},{"name":"x-rq","value":"sea4 103 5 3500"},{"name":"age","value":"463"},{"name":"x-cache","value":"miss"}],"content":{"mimeType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","size":98025,"text":"<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?><rss version=\"2.0\"\n\txmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"\n\txmlns:wfw=\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\"\n\txmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\n\txmlns:atom=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"\n\txmlns:sy=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/\"\n\txmlns:slash=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\"\n\t\n\txmlns:georss=\"http://www.georss.org/georss\"\n\txmlns:geo=\"http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#\"\n\t>\n\n<channel>\n\t<title>MIT Technology Review</title>\n\t<atom:link href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/feed/\" rel=\"self\" type=\"application/rss+xml\" />\n\t<link>https://www.technologyreview.com</link>\n\t<description></description>\n\t<lastBuildDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 21:48:03 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t<language>en-US</language>\n\t<sy:updatePeriod>\n\thourly\t</sy:updatePeriod>\n\t<sy:updateFrequency>\n\t1\t</sy:updateFrequency>\n\t<generator>https://wordpress.org/?v=5.6.2</generator>\n\n<image>\n\t<url>https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20130408-ftweekendmag-mit-0030-final-w0-1.jpg?w=32?crop=0px,33px,1272px,716px&#038;w=32px</url>\n\t<title>MIT Technology Review</title>\n\t<link>https://www.technologyreview.com</link>\n\t<width>32</width>\n\t<height>32</height>\n</image> \n<site xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">172986898</site>\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Announcing the MIT Technology Review Covid Inequality Fellowships</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/23/1019529/mit-technology-review-covid-inequality-fellowship-apply/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Bobbie Johnson]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 20:05:26 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tech and health]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tech policy]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Coronavirus]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.technologyreview.com/?p=1019529</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[Early in the pandemic, some headlines argued that covid-19 was the great equalizer—because anyone, no matter their circumstance, could catch it.

In reality, it was clear that the virus was affecting some groups of Americans in disproportionate, devastating ways.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Indigenous communities, and other people of color have been <a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/race\">affected the most, and are dying at much higher rates.</a> Incarcerated people have been left unprotected, and those in poverty have been<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/health-equity/data-10-cities-show-covid-19-impact-based-poverty-race\">among the hardest hit</a>. Schoolchildren from poorer backgrounds are suffering the biggest educational setbacks, with lifelong repercussions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know many of the reasons, including frontline jobs that expose workers to the virus, economic stresses, unstable housing and unequal health care that leads to worse outcomes. But there’s much more to learn, and much more to do about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help explore these issues and help people&#8217;s stories get told, we’ve joined with the <a href=\"https://www.hsfoundation.org/\">Heising Simons Foundation</a> to create five <strong>MIT</strong> <strong>Technology Review Covid Inequality Fellowships</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each fellowship provides <strong>up to $7,500</strong> of financial support to help journalists report and produce stories about covid inequality—and how it’s being tackled—in under-covered communities in the US. Applicants will be judged by a <strong>panel of experts</strong> that includes some of the most incisive journalists and informed experts working today. Fellows will receive <strong>editorial oversight and assistance</strong> from our award-winning team; and the end results will be <strong>published in MIT Technology Review</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applying for a Fellowship is straightforward: just take a look through our description of what we&#8217;re looking for, and then <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_zEZX9KrTXszESHnUPh-laGVqCID0k3H_xj2pG9uRIn6ECw/viewform?usp=sf_link\">start submitting your application.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Who should apply</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re offering two kinds of fellowship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Freelancer fellowships: </strong>Apply for this if you’re an independent journalist who is not already attached to a specific publication. You may come from one of the affected communities you plan to report on, or you may know of an important story about a group you have gotten to know well.<br><br><strong>Newsroom fellows: </strong>Apply for this if you’re a staff journalist working with a specific outlet, who is looking for extra support to follow up on a story that is important to you and the readers you serve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have journalistic experience, and you want to tell stories about the way covid is affecting people—and what’s being done about it—<a href=\"https://forms.gle/4Jepo2tM5KybnCBW8\">we encourage you to apply</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What we’re looking for</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your story—or series of stories—will focus on a specific group of people and show how they have been affected by covid-19. It will show the human impacts and explore what kind of disparities exist in exposure, safety, treatment, or outcomes. It may look at how communities are using technologies, developing systems, or building alliances to overcome the problems they face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MIT Technology Review is a publication about emerging technologies and the ways in which they are used, so we are particularly interested in:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The impact of vaccines and how they are distributed</li><li>Contact tracing, exposure notification, and/or the use of health data</li><li>How the pandemic is affecting the digital divide</li><li>Workplace virus protocols and surveillance</li><li>The impact of long covid on communities</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Above all, these are human stories, with people at their center and a search for solutions at their core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get there, we’re looking for people who are committed to telling stories with care and dedication while applying rigorous standards and maintaining journalistic integrity. You don’t have to have a long track record in healthcare or science reporting, but you do have to be determined, prepared to challenge preconceptions, and be comfortable asking for help and taking guidance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What we’re not looking for</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>These fellowships will not produce simplistic disaster narratives that underscore pre-existing tropes, and we don’t want parachute journalism from reporters who have no history with or insight into the communities they’re writing about. That doesn’t mean you have to identify as part of the community you’re proposing to cover, but it does mean you do have to show that you can report sensitively and thoroughly—and without further endangering them during the pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How we’ll support your work</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Successful applicants will receive up to $7,500 to report and publish their stories. Work will be produced in conjunction with MIT Technology Review and published on our website—or co-published, in the case of Newsroom Fellowships. This money can be used to cover any or all costs related to the story, including your own time, reporting expenses, and travel (where it is safe.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll provide editorial support to all fellows, with regular check-ins with our editors and advice from our team. For newsroom fellows, we’ll coordinate with your publication’s team to help you get the most out of the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Our panel of judges</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Entries will be examined by a panel of some of the leading journalists and voices on the subjects we’re looking at.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alexis Madrigal</strong> is a staff writer at <em>The Atlantic</em> and co-founder of the Covid Tracking Project, which compiles, annotates, and publishes high-quality data about the outbreak. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark J. Rochester </strong>is the editor in chief of Type Media Center, and was previously senior news director for investigations at the <em>Detroit Free Press</em>. He has served on the national board of directors of Investigative Reporters &amp; Editors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Krystal Tsosie </strong>is a Navajo bioethicist and geneticist at Vanderbilt University. She is an advocate for ethical genomic research that respects the rights of Indigenous people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Seema Yasmin</strong> is an Emmy Award-winning journalist, poet, medical doctor and author. She is currently director of the Stanford Health Communication Initiative at Stanford University, and a regular contributor on the covid pandemic for CNN.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gideon Lichfield</strong> is the editor in chief of MIT Technology Review. He joined the publication in 2017 after being a founding editor at Quartz and reporting from Moscow, Jerusalem, and Mexico City for The Economist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://forms.gle/4Jepo2tM5KybnCBW8\">Applications for the Fellowships are now open</a>. The final deadline for applications is Sunday March 21, 2021. Selected fellows will be announced in early April 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The fine print</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>These fellowships are US-only; Fellows must be legally able to work in the United States. Stories must be designed for text: although video and audio can be part of the output, your story will need to center around written journalism, which can include news reporting, narratives, or data. Projects do not have a minimum timescale, but drafts must be completed by the end of 2021. All stories will be subject to editing, fact-checking, and legal review.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the key things we’ll require in the first stage of the application process.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A well-written outline of your story or project of no more than 750 words. We are looking for a compelling pitch that gives an overview of the people, places, information, and issues that you will be bringing into the spotlight.</li><li>A reporting plan that includes (a) a proposed timeline and (b) an explanation of how you plan to report in a covid-safe manner on the communities you are focused on. Speed is not a factor in our decision, but it’s good to know how you plan to carry out the task of researching, reporting, and producing your story.</li><li>A written personal statement (maximum 500 words) telling us about your prior work, relevant experiences and your connection to the community you’re proposing to cover.</li><li>Three samples of original work. If this is not freely available online (for example, it is behind a paywall, or only available in print) please provide PDF files.</li><li>Newsroom fellowship applicants will be required to submit a letterhead statement confirming that you have the support of your publication.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortlisted applicants will be asked to provide more information, including a breakdown of how they’d spend the fellowship award, answer a questionnaire about the risks their project faces, and supply two letters of recommendation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have any questions about this application process, you can contact senior editor Bobbie Johnson by <a href=\"mailto:bobbie.johnson@technologyreview.com\">email</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://forms.gle/qdqE5biYZpXk5rHRA\"><strong>Click here to apply now</strong></a></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">1019529</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>For years, I’ve tried to work my way back into the middle class</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/23/1019477/homelessness-work-economy-inequality-middle-class/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Amy Nordrum]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Humans and technology]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.technologyreview.com/?p=1019477</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[Early this winter, I took a long walk in the Salt Lake City park in which I had been arrested for bathing in a river when I was homeless.

Now I see that these are also the lenses through which I have often judged my own progress in my new, not-yet-middle-class life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These days, I often wonder: <em>Am I really doing as well as I should be after all this time? How did I ever allow myself to fall so far? Trying to get back the economic security I had before that collapse is so hard! Is it even possible?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am the daughter of Vernon Yearwood-Drayton, a Black Panamanian immigrant who came to the US in the 1940s—the era of Jim Crow laws—to become a microbiologist at NASA’s Ames Research Center. My father made certain I graduated from college. He ate a lot of rice and beans to ensure that he left me with an inheritance he thought would keep me safe in a world without him.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Yet I am also a woman who, after a quick succession of traumas, plunged out of the protected realms of the middle class and into two years of homelessness. My experience is surprisingly common. From June to November 2020, nearly 8 million people in the US fell into poverty in the face of the pandemic and limited government relief, according to <a href=\"https://harris.uchicago.edu/files/monthly_poverty_rates_updated_thru_november_2020_final.pdf\">research</a> from the University of Chicago and the University of Notre Dame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poverty is a complicated thing. It can be generational or situational and temporary—or anything in between. For me, climbing out of poverty has been as much about mindset as it has been about the dollars in my bank account. “I am going to do this,” I tell myself over and over again. “I have inherited the strength from my father to do this.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the spring of 2017, I finally left my last makeshift “home”—a slatted wood park bench in that same park. My first job during my recovery was as an $11-an-hour grocery clerk at a Whole Foods store where my 20-something bosses handed me pre-set timers whenever I took a bathroom break. As a former journalist who had risen through the ranks of the Miami Herald to write cover stories for the paper’s Sunday magazine, I stood at my register, struggling to hold back tears.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote alignright\"><blockquote><p>From June to November 2020, nearly 8 million people in the US fell into poverty.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Well-meaning people tried to encourage me by pointing out how far I had come. “You’re working!” they said, “You’re housed!” And the declaration I found most diminishing: “I’m so proud of you!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was 52 and I did not mark my progress by those measurements. Rather, I marked my progress by how far I had fallen. What did it mean that I was earning enough to rent a room in someone&#8217;s house when just a few years ago, I had owned a three-acre horse ranch in Oregon?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most debilitating symptoms of post-traumatic stress is that people who suffer from it avoid the things that hurt them most. For me, that meant I avoided myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was full of shame and self-hatred. Hatred that I—someone who had once had hundreds of thousands of dollars in the stock market—had collapsed. Hatred that I had become one of “them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through tears, I told my trauma therapist how I was regularly stalked and beaten by a man who worked the front counter of the homeless outreach center where I had picked up my daily hygiene kits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If you don’t love that part of yourself that you have so successfully distanced yourself from, you will not be able to fully heal,” my therapist said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Slowly, after many sessions, I came to feel great compassion for the desperate woman I once was. I envisioned myself sitting beside her in the streets, holding her and telling her: “I am so sorry. I will never separate myself from you again. I will take care of you.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My incremental but steady steps forward did not come from the expected governmental or community resources. They came from a series of strangers who cared about my welfare. The systems that our society has in place to lift people out of poverty are fragile and full of holes, so I learned to look elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>My first home out of homelessness, for example, was offered by the executive director of a small Salt Lake City nonprofit. Housing lists had one- to two-year waiting lists at the time, so she offered me a room in a home of formerly incarcerated women in exchange for managing the other women in the house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That house experienced funding issues and closed six months later. But another stranger, a woman I met quite by chance at a neighborhood gathering, offered me free shelter in her Airbnb for a month and then rented me a small bedroom in her home for $400 a month, about $100 less than market rate. My $11-an-hour cashiering job was just enough to pay my expenses and to cover the trauma therapy I knew I needed to keep moving forward.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If there is any single piece of advice I could give anyone else in the midst of collapse, it would be this: No matter what the world tries to project onto you, stop judging yourself. Learn about trauma and its impact on your psychology and physiology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By many measures, my life today could once again be counted as successful. My jobs have become increasingly suited to what I now see as my purpose—to help people, including me, say the things that need to be heard. I’m now a full-time freelance journalist who specializes in integrating trauma awareness into my stories. I am under contract with <a href=\"https://economichardship.org/\">the Economic Hardship Reporting Project</a> and have been published in <a href=\"https://economichardship.org/author/loriteresayearwood/\">major media outlets</a> such as the Washington Post, Slate, and the Guardian. I love my one-bedroom apartment in Salt Lake City, where I live with my two cats, Iggy and Kanab.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I began this piece by talking about a simple walk in a park for a reason. To an onlooker, it would have looked like a completely ordinary act. But for me to walk in that park without resenting myself for all that had occurred there was just as much of an accomplishment as any job I had landed. When I stood in front of that white stone meditation temple and thought of that past me lying on its floor, I accepted her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This story was supported by the Economic Hardship Reporting Project.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Lori Teresa Yearwood is the Homelessness and Housing reporter for the Economic Hardship Reporting Project.

The spacecraft survived its “<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/17/1018729/nasa-perseverance-rover-landing-searching-extraterrestrial-life-mars/\">seven minutes of terror</a>”—its entry through the Martian atmosphere and descent to the surface. On the way down, the rover’s cameras snapped images and recorded a wealth of video footage that has given us a historic view of the nail-biting moment it touched down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The landing footage:</strong> On February 22, NASA released a three-and-a-half-minute video that stitched together footage of the rover’s landing recorded by five different cameras (three on the spacecraft’s back shell, one on the descent stage used to drop the rover on the ground, and two on the rover itself; one camera on the back shell failed).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Perseverance Rover’s Descent and Touchdown on Mars (Official NASA Video)\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4czjS9h4Fpg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The video begins after the spacecraft has withstood the 1,300 °C entrance into the Martian atmosphere. Sky-facing cameras on the back shell show the deployment of the 150-pound parachute in less than a second, which slowed the spacecraft down as it raced toward the surface. Then ground-facing cameras from the rover’s bottom show the heat shield separating and falling to the ground, from about 9.5 kilometers above the surface. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The red landscape is shown in exquisite detail, dotted hills and ledges as well as craters and small valleys, coming into closer focus as the rover continues to descend. When the rover gets close to the ground, the video shifts to sky-facing cameras from the rover and ground-facing cameras from the descent stage as the descent stage drops the rover down from its cords and slows the descent using its reverse thrusters. Finally, after the rover touches down on the surface, we see the descent vehicle detach and fly offscreen, to crash someplace nearby. Perseverance has landed. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-soundcloud wp-block-embed-soundcloud wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Sounds from Mars by NASA\" width=\"500\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F1215546463&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=500&#038;maxheight=750&#038;dnt=1\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sounding off: </strong>Perseverance also made history by taking the first audio recording of sound on Mars. A snippet of noise was made available that includes the sound of 5-mile-per-hour winds blowing through the Martian landscape. (This is distinct from what was released from the InSight lander a couple of years ago, which measured vibrations coming from the Martian ground and <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/10/03/132769/you-can-now-listen-to-rumbling-marsquakes-heard-by-nasas-mars-lander/\">converted those signals into audio</a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rover is fitted with two microphones—one designed to take audio of the rover’s landing last week, and one fitted in the rover’s SuperCam instrument. The former microphone unfortunately failed to collect data properly. It does not seem to be a hardware issue, and NASA officials speculate there was a communication error between the system that converts sound from analog to digital and the onboard computer.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Both microphones are now working and are expected to continue collecting sound for a while. The landing microphone was not designed for sustained use on the Martian surface, and the planet’s temperature fluxes will probably cause it to degrade quickly. But the SuperCam microphone has been made for resilience and should last longer. NASA has said it may be possible to use the microphones to keep track of the health of the rover and its instruments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What’s next: </strong>Perseverance will be transferring to new software optimized for its surface mission (<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/17/1018729/nasa-perseverance-rover-landing-searching-extraterrestrial-life-mars/\">to look for signs of ancient life on Mars</a>), and NASA officials will spend a few weeks testing instruments and preparing for the deployment of the <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/17/1018729/nasa-perseverance-rover-landing-searching-extraterrestrial-life-mars/\">Ingenuity helicopter</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Your front-row seat to my Mars landing is here.

Many look at the decline of the news industry as one contributing factor. No wonder, then, that figuring out how to pay for journalism is an urgent issue, and some governments are pushing ahead with ambitious plans. Big ideas for ways to funnel billions of dollars back into newsrooms are rare, but it’s time to take a gamble on more than one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such an idea rose to the world’s attention this week: an Australian law that would compel search and social media platforms to pay news organizations for linking to their content. Google has decided to comply with the law and is doing deals with major companies such as News Corp, Nine, and Seven West Media. But Facebook took the other route—rather than pay for news to appear on its platform, the social media giant blocked Australian users from accessing and sharing news entirely. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reactions have been swift. Some commentators pounced on Facebook’s actions as proof of its monopolistic intent and lack of concern for civic discourse. Others blame the Australian government for bowing to the protectionist interests of media cronies such as Rupert Murdoch, and putting tech companies in an absurd position.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote alignleft\"><blockquote><p>What else can be done to push billions of dollars back into journalism?</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Australia’s approach is now being considered by lawmakers and regulators in multiple other governments. Reuters <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/SOMNIA-idUSKBN2AI2ZY\">reports</a> that Canadian heritage minister Steven Guilbeault said Canada will model its own legislation on the Australian law. There are also some similarities in a <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2054/text\">bill</a> proposed by US congressman David Cicilline of Rhode Island that would “provide a temporary safe harbor for the publishers of online content to collectively negotiate with dominant online platforms regarding the terms on which their content may be distributed.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, these measures seek to boost the bargaining power of news organizations and help them extract value from tech giants for the content that newsrooms produce. The Australian model’s novelty lies in its arbitration mechanism, a kind of membrane between the parties intended to help them arrive at a fair exchange of value. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Australian law will likely pass, so this grand experiment in pushing capital back to the news media will soon be under way. We’ll get to see how it works out, and whether opponents’ concerns bear out—if larger news organizations are privileged over small ones, for instance, or whether the money actually ends up being spent on producing more journalism.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in view of the objections to this approach, what other options exist? If new subscription models are not enough to sustain the media industry, what else can be done to push billions of dollars back into journalism?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>A raft of ideas can be found in the archives of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which studied this problem extensively in the early 2000s. The commission’s <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_events/how-will-journalism-survive-internet-age/new-staff-discussion.pdf\">2010 paper</a> “Potential Policy Recommendations to Support the Reinvention of Journalism” found “reasons for concern that experimentation may not produce a robust and sustainable business model for commercial journalism.” So the authors went on to look for other pots of gold.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One idea put forward in the report was antitrust exemptions to “allow news organizations to agree jointly on a mechanism to require news aggregators and others to pay for the use of online content,” which sounds a lot like the Australian law.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But others are more novel, such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A spectrum auction tax. This intervention would seek not to extract a pound of flesh from platform companies, but rather to mine the profits of mobile operators and broadcasters by taxing the licenses they purchase for the right to operate on specific frequencies, with the proceeds going to some kind of public media fund. This year, for instance, the 5G mobile spectrum (considered a public resource) <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/31/5g-spectrum-auction-bids-total-80point9-billion-winners-revealed-soon.html\">fetched</a> more than $80 billion at auction. Since the proceeds go to the US Treasury, Congress could decide that some portion of the revenue should be put toward journalism.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Advertising taxes. Rather than forcing tech platforms to pay news companies directly, governments could simply assess a tax on digital advertising. In its 2010 report, the FTC surmised that a 2% sales tax on advertising would generate $5 to $6 billion annually that could go toward journalism. Maryland has just <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/18/tech/maryland-digital-ad-tax-lawsuit/index.html\">put forward</a> legislation to introduce a tax on digital advertising, which it intends to use to fund another public good—education. (The big tech companies oppose it vehemently.)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Taxes on cell phone plans. Another way to pay for public media would be for consumers to pay a small tax on their monthly cell phone bills. In 2010 dollars, a tax of 3% on the monthly fees would have generated $6 billion annually, and there are roughly 120 million more US mobile subscriptions <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/186122/number-of-mobile-cellular-subscriptions-in-the-united-states-since-2000/\">today</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The FTC report is replete with suggestions for alternative tax structures, copyright advantages, and other creative mechanisms to sustain journalism, as well as ideas for how to provide more direct subsidies to the news industry. In addition to these ideas, I think there’s another possibility that Congress should consider: funding journalism by diverting fines against the tech platforms for privacy and antitrust violations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, in 2019 the FTC <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/12/tech/facebook-ftc-settlement/index.html\">announced</a> a $5 billion fine against Facebook for multiple privacy violations, including the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Five billion dollars is double the endowment of the Knight Foundation, one of the most generous philanthropies investing in journalism today. And that same year, Google <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/09/google-youtube-will-pay-record-170-million-alleged-violations\">settled</a> allegations that it violated children’s privacy by paying the FTC $170 million.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not difficult to imagine a mechanism that could divert fines from privacy and antitrust violations to a quasi-governmental foundation. Over time, that foundation’s endowment could more than sustain the losses to the news industry over the past two decades—the entire industry <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/02/14/fast-facts-about-the-newspaper-industrys-financial-struggles/\">earned</a> just under $25 billion last year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current political climate in the US and elsewhere makes it likely that governments will increasingly seek to divert funds from tech platforms to the news media. A recent <a href=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/competition_in_digital_markets.pdf?utm_campaign=4493-519\">report</a> from the US House titled “Investigation of Competition in Digital Markets,” led in part by Congressman Cicilline, concluded plainly that “the emergence of platform gatekeepers—and the market power wielded by these firms—has contributed to the decline of trustworthy sources of news.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But forcing tech companies to pay the news media directly—with all the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KetanJ0/status/1362679025630670850?s=20\">hazards</a> that may generate—is only one option. If the goal is to recapitalize journalism at scale, it’s time to get creative. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This op-ed was updated to better characterize Facebook’s decision in Australia.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Justin Hendrix is CEO and editor of </em><a href=\"https://techpolicy.press/\"><em>Tech Policy Press</em></a><em>, a new nonprofit media venture concerned with technology and democracy.

Its lead authors are Sharon Alroy-Preis, head of public health for Israel’s health ministry, and Eric Haas, a ministry researcher. In addition, the study was carried out by a team of eight Pfizer researchers, including epidemiologists Farid Khan and John McLaughlin and the company’s global medical lead for covid vaccines, David Swerdlow, an infectious disease expert previously with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The research represents the first joint report by the health ministry and Pfizer since they reached an agreement earlier this year for Israel to share vaccination data in return for a steady supply of doses. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cooperation is part of a wider effort by Pfizer to track how its vaccine, named Comirnaty, works in large populations. The company told MIT Technology Review earlier this week that it is studying “the vaccine’s real-world effectiveness at several locations worldwide, including Israel,” and “particularly looking at real-world data from Israel to understand any potential impact of the vaccine to protect against covid-19 arising from emerging variants.” Pfizer’s vaccine, like one from Moderna, another mRNA vaccine authorized for use in the US and Europe, uses two injections of<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/05/1017366/messenger-rna-vaccines-covid-hiv/\"> messenger RNA</a> carrying information about the virus to train people’s immune system to recognize and combat the infection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new findings are broadly consistent with separate announcements in recent days from two of Israel’s large health organizations, Maccabi Healthcare Services and Clalit Health Services, which together care for 80% of Israelis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On February 14, Ran Balicer, chief of innovation and research at Clalit, the largest Israeli HMO, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-israel-vaccine/israeli-study-finds-94-drop-in-symptomatic-covid-19-cases-with-pfizer-vaccine-idINKBN2AE0Q2\">said</a> that evidence collected on 1.2 million members “shows unequivocally that Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine is extremely effective in the real world a week after the second dose.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other analyses suggest that serious infections and deaths have fallen among older Israelis, who got the vaccine first, but not among those younger than 44 who have not been vaccinated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Israeli report describes observations made during three weeks in January and February when researchers were able to compare health records of unvaccinated people and people who had gotten their second shot more than a week before. They then compared the groups for five covid-19 outcomes: infection, symptoms, hospitalizations, critical hospitalization, and death. The unpublished study says the vaccine was around 93% effective in preventing symptomatic covid-19. Pfizer and its partner, the German biotechnology firm BioNTech, had found 95% effectiveness in their clinical trials carried out in 2020. The country-wide study was also able to show that hospitalizations and deaths dropped by similar amounts in the vaccinated group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because Israel tests people fairly comprehensively, the researchers were also able to estimate that the vaccine was 89.4% effective in preventing any detectable infection at all, including asymptomatic infections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That finding, which is new, suggests that the vaccine could strongly suppress transmission of the virus between people and could help bring the outbreak to an end, a possibility Pfizer and the Israeli researchers say they are closely watching. “Israel provides a unique opportunity to observe the nation-wide impact of an increasing prevalence of immunity on Sars-Cov-2 transmission,” the authors wrote. Eric Topol, a doctor at Scripps Research in California, who reviewed the document, says that “the blocking of infections here speaks to the vaccine’s impact on asymptomatic transmission, which we’ve been unsure about.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>But Topol cautioned that the current study is “not conclusive on its own” and that ruling out asymptomatic transmission will require more frequent testing, <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/02/1017161/covid-vaccine-asymptomatic-transmission-pfizer-trial/\">a type of study </a>that Pfizer is also undertaking. Another unknown, says Topol, is whether or not protection from the vaccines wanes with time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Success against the varian<strong>t</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The vaccination campaign in Israel occurred just as the hyper-transmissible “British” variant of the virus, called B.1.1.7, began to predominate. The B.1.1.7 variant was first reported in Israel on December 23 and was the cause of just over 80% of infections there by the middle of February.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lab research has suggested that vaccines should be just as effective against B.1.1.7 as against the earlier strains, and the real-world experience in Israel is overwhelmingly confirming this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“B.1.1.7 can be squashed with aggressive vaccination, which is big,” says Topol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other variants of the virus remain a concern, however. This week, Pfizer and BioNTech said laboratory tests pointed to weaker protection against a variant spreading in South Africa, known as B.1.351, which other vaccines have struggled against as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the South African variant is present in Israel, there were not enough cases to weight the vaccine’s success against it. The report cautions that “progress towards herd immunity in Israel could be disrupted” by new variants if the vaccine is less effective against them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Herd immunity</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Herd immunity is the threshold at which cases would start to decline even without measures like masks and distancing, because the virus would run out of susceptible people to infect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The exact proportion of the population that would have to be immune to reach this threshold is unknown, however—estimates range from 60% to 85%—and it r<a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/02/17/what-if-countries-that-excel-at-vaccinating-their-citizens-still-dont-reach-herd-immunity/\">emains to be seen how many Israelis ultimately agree to be vaccinated</a>. Vaccination is optional in the country and is viewed with more skepticism by younger age groups, as well as <a href=\"https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2021/0204/How-Orthodox-defiance-of-pandemic-lockdowns-is-cleaving-Israel\">among ultra-Orthodox Jews</a> and Bedouin Arabs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Demand for the Pfizer shots in Israel has fallen 37% from a daily peak in January, when the vaccine was still restricted to medical staff and those older than 60. Also, children under 16 are not yet being vaccinated, and they make up about 29% percent of the country’s population.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pfizer vaccine requires two shots spaced 21 days apart, although results published in the journal Lancet on Thursday, which were also based on findings in Israel, suggest that even <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/single-dose-of-pfizer-vaccine-is-85-effective-israeli-study-shows-11613723218\">a single shot is about 85% effective </a>two to three weeks after it’s given.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Good news</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>None of that means the vaccine is foolproof, and Israel is still recording some deaths even among those who’ve been vaccinated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, overall the Pfizer results provide an encouraging picture for many other countries as they race to catch up with Israel’s vaccination efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The US, which is vaccinating more than 1.5 million people a day with both the Pfizer and Moderna shots, holds the record for the most doses given overall—around 56 million. But with its larger population size, that amounts to only about 4.6% fully vaccinated.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>On Tuesday, February 16, President Joe Biden outlined a goal of vaccinating the whole country within six months. “By the end of July we will have 600 million doses, enough to vaccinate every single American,” he said during a televised town hall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other countries confront bigger hurdles to vaccinating their populations. They may lack access to the messenger RNA vaccines, rely on less effective shots, face shortages, or struggle to access any supplies at all. Most of the developing world may not be fully vaccinated until 2023, according to some estimates, and that may include some of Israel’s neighbors. So far, <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/22/1016471/israel-covid-vaccine-rollout-hadas-ziv/\">Israel has not made its supply of vaccines available </a>to most of some 5 million Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">1019264</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The government failed Texans—so people on the internet stepped in</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/19/1019281/the-government-failed-texas-so-people-on-the-internet-stepped-in/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Tanya Basu]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 17:36:33 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Humans and technology]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[climate change]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Humans and Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[politics]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[social media]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tech and health]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.technologyreview.com/?p=1019281</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[On Valentine’s Day, Texas plunged into a polar vortex the likes of which hadn’t been seen since 1899.

Freezing temperatures led to widespread power outages. Homes more used to the swampy heat were useless against the wind and cold, with pipes bursting and ceilings caving in. Where water, clothing, and food were being distributed, lines snaked around the block. Hundreds of people in Texas have been made homeless so far. At least 30<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/02/18/winter-storm-deaths/\"> have died.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The official response was sluggish and inadequate. <a href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/FEMA-sending-generators-water-blankets-to-Texas-15957563.php\">It took until Thursday</a> for the federal government to step in and send generators, water, and blankets to affected areas, and local municipalities struggled to coordinate efforts to clear roads and restore access to water.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But within hours of the storm’s onset, a predictable pandemic-era sequence of events took place: people stepped into the void left by the government. With the pandemic and icy roads preventing them from going door to door to help their neighbors, they created simple, shareable Google docs that went quickly viral on Instagram and Twitter, giving residents in affected communities and beyond instant access to information that bypassed national organizations. Venmo, Cash App, and GoFundMe pages funneled funds directly to those in need. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Mutual aid is not a new concept, long flourishing in marginalized communities. But a year of pandemic-induced crises has trained such groups to react quickly: they know that the first place people will turn in a crisis is the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mellissa Martinez, a 24-year-old student based in Houston, was without electricity or internet access for 72 hours. But during spurts of Wi-Fi availability, she was able to cobble together the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rdMnbzYxfXFrG1DefGqN3R1zu_lan2fml2bEYRpMcRQ/edit\">TX Mutual Aid Directory</a>, which lists shelter locations, food pantries, and requests for supplies. Martinez, a member of the Sunrise Movement, a political action committee aimed at fighting climate change, says much of the groundwork for the document was done in January after the Capitol Hill insurrection. “We were showing we need to take care of each other,” she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I have just been updating it whenever I could get any signal at all,” Martinez managed to tell me, before her signal dropped again. When she called back she added, “That’s all I did for 72 hours: just nonstop staring at the page and refreshing it. People needed us to scramble and shoot out the directory.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christina Tan, a 22-year-old with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mutualaidhou\">Mutual Aid Houston</a>, says the group coordinated within hours. “We knew we had to activate quickly to help folks who were trapped in cold apartments or houses with no way of driving on icy roads,” she says. “We also knew that a lot of folks would be in need of help with electricity bills, burst pipes, medical assistance, and more.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mutual Aid Houston has a reliable social media plan that it enacted immediately. “Twitter is appealing since it allows us to update folks live with resources such as restaurants donating food or locations to pick up water; it also lets us talk to people one-to-one through DMs and quickly identify people in need,” says Tan. “Instagram is for visuals, which is useful when directing folks places, and especially for raising money … We primarily use Venmo and Cash App to distribute money directly back to people, although we are exploring ways to reach people without bank accounts or without digital banking.” Tan says the nine-person volunteer team is collaborating constantly on Slack and Zoom.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Not every volunteer is based locally. Ivan Sheth, a 37-year-old in New York, saw the Texas crisis and created <a href=\"https://app.slack.com/client/T01NP4BPNPN/C01NP4NJQJG\">Slack</a> and <a href=\"about:blank\">Telegram</a> groups <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11GplfTTLRv6yV-2AC6GFw5Gy4izlPdGSay1HdRQcRjQ/edit\">within a mutual aid Google doc</a> to organize people across the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sheth, who is currently unemployed, found it distressing and frustrating to be helpless. “I have more free time on my hands than I want to or know what to do with,” he says. “My fellow Americans are in trouble, and I feel a civic duty to my fellow countrymen and women.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it shouldn’t have to be this way—and there is still considerable anger among activists at the government’s slow response. Ice storms may become more frequent as a result of climate change, and <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/17/texas-power-grid-failures/\">officials were warned repeatedly that infrastructure may collapse</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is a crisis that needed government action,” Tan says. “Infrastructural problems like the electric grid and road safety are far too massive for grassroots groups to tackle.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Martinez voices similar frustration. “We don’t have representatives representing our values. They’re willfully being deaf to our cries,” she says. “But I have high hopes for the future.”</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">1019281</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>A first-of-its-kind geoengineering experiment is about to take its first step</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/19/1018813/harvard-first-geoengineering-experiments-in-stratosphere-sweden/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Emily Luong]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 14:36:51 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Climate change]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Geoengineering]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.technologyreview.com/?p=1018813</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[Trapped inside a long glass tube in a ground-floor lab at Harvard University is a miniature copy of the stratosphere.

By filling it with the right combination of gases, at particular temperatures and pressures, Keutsch and his colleagues had simulated the conditions some 20 kilometers above Earth’s surface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In testing how various chemicals react in this rarefied air, the team hoped to conduct a crude test of a controversial scheme known as solar geoengineering, which aims to counter climate change by spraying tiny particles into the stratosphere to reflect more of the sun’s heat back into space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But is what’s in that tube “really what the stratosphere is like?” asks Keutsch, a professor of engineering, chemistry, and atmospheric science, as he gestured toward it. “That’s the question. We try to think of everything, but I would argue you never quite know.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why he and fellow researchers, including Harvard climate scientist David Keith, want to move their experiments out of their toy stratosphere and up into the real one. They hope to conduct <a href=\"https://www.keutschgroup.com/scopex\">a series of scientific balloon flights</a>, the first of which could launch from the Esrange Space Center in Kiruna, Sweden, as soon as this summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\"><p>I seriously hope we’ll never get in a situation where this actually has to be done, because I still think this is a very scary concept and something will go wrong.</p><cite>Frank Keutsch, principal investigator of SCoPEx</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial flight will simply evaluate whether the aircraft’s equipment and software work properly in the stratosphere, where temperatures can plunge below -50 ˚C and the pressure ranges from one tenth to one thousandth the amount at sea level. But in subsequent launches, the researchers hope to release small amounts of the sorts of particles that could scatter sunlight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a world that’s cutting carbon dioxide emissions too slowly to prevent catastrophic climate change, solar geoengineering might buy some time. But doing it on a large scale could mean messing with planet-wide weather patterns. The effects are unpredictable; in some places, they might even be disastrous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the coming weeks, therefore, an independent advisory committee <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/07/29/133999/geoengineering-experiment-harvard-creates-governance-committee-climate-change/\">that is reviewing the legal, ethical, and environmental issues surrounding the project</a> is expected to determine whether the research group should proceed with the first flight. The committee will also have to rule before any flights that actually release materials, and determine what steps the research team should or must take to engage with the public and regulators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If those launches are approved—and that’s still a big if—they will be the first geoengineering experiments in the stratosphere. But before the balloons have even left the ground, they’re <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg/status/1360564476819501056?s=20\">already drawing criticism</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Too dangerous to use</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea of cooling the planet by dispersing particles in the atmosphere, dimming sunlight and offsetting some of the warming driven by greenhouse-gas emissions, has a precedent: nature already does it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Major volcanic eruptions such as Mount Pinatubo in 1991 have <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614079/what-is-geoengineering-and-why-should-you-care-climate-change-harvard/\">spewed millions of tons of sulfur dioxide</a> into the air, depressing global temperatures in the years that followed. The sulfur dioxide emitted from coal plants and ships <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610007/were-about-to-kill-a-massive-accidental-experiment-in-halting-global-warming/\">produces measurable cooling effects</a> as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To some critics, doing this deliberately as a measure against climate change is reckless even to ponder, let alone experiment with. Some studies have found that solar geoengineering could significantly alter rainfall patterns and cut some crop yields <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2016GL071209\">in certain places</a>. On the other hand, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0398-8.epdf?author_access_token=x3zmdmtKoXS1uJKgVB9OPNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0OEvapK86-44yHpunDU3VD1pOSqb63XL89kDmpVh6nv9jfsuoKLddENVx7T2dMuSkkhj_Tb--jJZloxsiVfrAaXj0_Ib-WnLKWAVJVqpgqoWA%3D%3D\">other</a> <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab76de\">papers</a> have concluded that the environmental side effects could be small so long as geoengineering <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/risks-of-controversial-geoengineering-approach-may-be-overstated/\">is done in a moderate way</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But all the research done to date, <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/08/09/615/what-is-geoengineering-and-why-should-you-care-climate-change-harvard/\">with a few small-scale exceptions</a>, has been conducted in computer models or lab experiments. So Keutsch and his colleagues argue that their balloon trials are a critical next step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The basic idea for their so-called SCoPEx experiments, <a href=\"https://keith.seas.harvard.edu/publications/stratospheric-controlled-perturbation-experiment-scopex-small-scale-experiment\">first proposed back in 2014</a>, is to launch a balloon, equipped with propellers and sensors, that would release up to two kilograms of sub-micrometer-size particles in a roughly kilometer-long plume. A commercial airliner pumps out similar amounts of material every minute, <a href=\"https://keith.seas.harvard.edu/news/fear-solar-geoengineering-healthy-%E2%80%93-dont-distort-our-research\">Keith notes</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then the balloon would tack around and slowly zigzag through the plume from the opposite direction. Its sensors would attempt to measure how widely the particles disperse, how they interact with other compounds, and how much sunlight they reflect.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2252\" height=\"2252\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PAYLOAD-CONCEPT-CAD.jpg?w=2000\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1019180\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PAYLOAD-CONCEPT-CAD.jpg 2252w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PAYLOAD-CONCEPT-CAD.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PAYLOAD-CONCEPT-CAD.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PAYLOAD-CONCEPT-CAD.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PAYLOAD-CONCEPT-CAD.jpg?resize=2000,2000 2000w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PAYLOAD-CONCEPT-CAD.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PAYLOAD-CONCEPT-CAD.jpg?resize=2048,2048 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2252px) 100vw, 2252px\" /><div class=\"image-credit\">COURTESY OF SCOPEX</div>\n</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever they found could be fed back into computer models, refining our understanding of what spraying <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aae98d/meta#acknowledgements\">hundreds of thousands to millions of tons</a> of material may do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, the team hopes to conduct a series of flights over a number of years. At first, they intend to release a fine dust of calcium carbonate—the principal ingredient of chalk—but eventually the researchers want to test other materials, likely including sulfuric acid (which is a by-product of the sulfur dioxide released from volcanoes).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But some fear that even these limited experiments are a step too far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil Burns, co-director of the Institute for Carbon Removal Law &amp; Policy at American University, believes there should be an attempt to reach some kind of global consensus about whether society should ever use such a tool before outdoor experiments go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for him, the answer is no: The environmental impacts are unknown. The challenges of governing such a tool are immense—a single country could carry out solar geoengineering on its own, but all countries would be affected. And future generations could be forced to manage the effects for hundreds of years. He adds that we can’t know what it will really do at a planetary scale until it’s fully deployed—and at point, we’ll be stuck with any droughts or other dangers until the effects subside. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some environmental groups and <a href=\"https://www.geoengineeringmonitor.org/2021/02/letter-to-the-swedish-government-on-planned-scopex-test-flight/\">geoengineering critics</a> are calling on government officials in Sweden, where the first SCoPEx flight would launch, and the heads of the Swedish Space Corporation, which would manage them, to oppose the experiments. They argue not that the research itself presents environmental risks but that it creates a “slippery slope toward normalization and deployment” of a perilous and powerful tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solar geoengineering “is a technology with the potential for extreme consequences, and stands out as dangerous, unpredictable, and unmanageable,” reads a letter issued by Greenpeace Sweden, Biofuelwatch, and other groups. “There is no justification for testing and experimenting with technology that seems to be too dangerous to ever be used.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The reluctant researcher</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Keutsch says it’s a “very valid” fear that geoengineering experiments could make eventual use of the technology more likely. As he told me during an interview in his office, he himself thinks geoengineering is the wrong way to address climate change. He compared it to opiates that ease acute pain but lead to other problems like addiction. The far safer, more effective solution would be to rapidly slash greenhouse-gas emissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, he fears, climate change is so far along and so likely to become so disruptive that some desperate nation may move ahead with geoengineering anyway. An earlier <a href=\"https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2018/11/calculating-solar-geoengineerings-technical-costs\">Harvard study found</a> that the cost of developing and flying a fleet of specialized planes to do the job would cost as little as $2 billion a year, putting it within the economic reach of many countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since it’s the only tool that could make any real difference to global temperatures within the period of a political term, it could become an incredibly seductive option in nations suffering through deadly heat waves, droughts, famines, fires, or floods. Using it without sufficient research would be “very dangerous,” Keutsch says.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/k-portrait.jpg?w=1557\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1019178\" width=\"421\" height=\"537\"/><figcaption>Harvard professor Frank Keutsch, principal investigator of SCoPEx.</figcaption><div class=\"image-credit\">ELIZA GRINNELL, HARVARD SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND APPLIED SCIENCE</div>\n</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>“People think that because I’m doing geoengineering research I sort of want to do geoengineering,” he says. “My view is actually very strongly that I seriously hope we’ll never get in a situation where this actually has to be done, because I still think this is a very scary concept and something will go wrong.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“But at the same time, I think better understanding what the risks may be is very important,” he adds. “And I think for the direct research I’m most interested in, if there is a type of material that can significantly reduce risks, I do think we should know about this.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Oversight</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The team <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/03/24/153028/harvard-scientists-moving-ahead-on-plans-for-atmospheric-geoengineering-experiments/\">initially hoped</a> to begin balloon flights as early as 2018 in Tucson, Arizona, and subsequently explored plans in New Mexico. They opted to <a href=\"https://www.keutschgroup.com/scopex\">move the first effort to Sweden</a> because of “COVID-19 and other logistical and scheduling challenges,” according to the project website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of the delay was due to the Keutsch team’s decision to set up an independent committee to evaluate the ethical and legal impacts of their proposed experiments. They didn’t have to have one, since the research effort has no federal funding. (Indeed, when the project began, <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/12/20/131449/the-us-government-will-begin-to-fund-geoengineering-research/\">there <em>was </em>no US federal funding</a> for geoengineering research. The project runs on internal Harvard money and donations from individuals and groups including <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/14/1018296/bill-gates-climate-change-beef-trees-microsoft/\">Bill Gates</a>, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, <a href=\"https://scopexac.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Full-Financial-Disclosure_Website.pdf\">and others</a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Jane Long, a former associate director at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, strongly recommended that an external review committee be created. (She also helped pick its chairperson.) “It was important for the future of this technology that they’re not seen as bad scientists running off to do some experiment without any review,” she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Long stresses that the experiments, as first proposed, are very&nbsp;small scale&nbsp;and unlikely to&nbsp;present health or environmental dangers. But the board, she says, forces the researchers to articulate what the work is for and to address public concerns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The committee has already issued a report providing suggestions on how the research team should communicate with the public before any flights that release particles. Among other things, <a href=\"https://scopexac.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/FINAL-SCoPEx-Societal-Engagement-Outline-1_8_2021.pdf\">it recommend</a>s creating a briefing book to explain the issues and inviting people who live near the balloons’ flight path to “participate in deliberative dialogue about the experiment itself as well as governance of solar geoengineering research.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, Burns and others argue that the committee is missing some crucial voices, including critics of geoengineering research and representatives from poorer countries. And he believes these blind spots are evident in the committee’s initial report. “It assumes, and kind of evinces a bias, that we’re only doing the public engagement to figure out how to get to the next stage in terms of field experiments—and that seems to be creating a kind of foregone conclusion in terms of what will happen and what should happen,” he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What they might learn</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Keutsch’s team has already <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020JD033438\">run computer simulations</a> exploring how the particles released from their equipment will dissipate into the air. If and when they starting testing this for real, they should be able to measure more precisely how specks of calcium carbonate or sulfuric acid spread out or clump together—a crucial test of how well these materials might work for geoengineering. If the particles are too big, they’ll sink too quickly out of the stratosphere, requiring more materials to scatter the same amount of sunlight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another crucial question is how the particles will react with other chemicals in the stratosphere—particularly the calcium carbonate, since it doesn’t occur up there naturally.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"865\" height=\"591\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FlightPath.png?w=865\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1019177\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FlightPath.png 865w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FlightPath.png?resize=300,205 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FlightPath.png?resize=768,525 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px\" /><div class=\"image-credit\">COURTESY OF SCOPEX</div>\n</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The team chose calcium carbonate instead of sulfates for two reasons, Keutsch says: sulfates eat away at the protective ozone layer, and while they have a cooling effect at the Earth’s surface, they warm the stratosphere. That could stir up weather patterns in ways that could be hard to foresee. “You are trying to poke the Earth system in ways that I don’t think our models are good at predicting,” he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Calcium carbonate comes with its own unknowns, however. Those experiments in the glass tube <a href=\"https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2020/12/laboratory-experiments-particles-solar-geoengineering-demonstrate-limits-models\">found</a> that it is not particularly reactive with the compounds it will encounter in the stratosphere. But the way it interacts with other chemicals in the real one could affect how much ultraviolet radiation is absorbed and how much sunlight is scattered. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The observations from the flights could help refine our understanding of how much of these materials may be needed to lower global temperatures, what risks releasing them could pose—or whether it will work at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there will still be real limits on what the researchers can learn from tiny balloon experiments. They won’t be able to detect the longer-term fate of particles released into the stratosphere, because they’ll quickly become too dilute to detect. Moreover, Keutsch acknowledges, there are simply some things that can’t be known until someone deploys solar geoengineering at full scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The Earth system is so complex,” he says. “I don’t think we can predict entirely. We can’t ever be really sure of what’s going to happen when you do this.”</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">1018813</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>This is the first image taken by NASA&#8217;s Perseverance Mars rover.

The spacecraft survived its journey through the Martian atmosphere and made a soft touchdown at Jezero crater.&nbsp;Shortly after landing, it sent back this picture from the surface using its Hazard Avoidance Cameras&nbsp;, which it will use when on the move. The image is partially obscured by a dust cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What happened: </strong>Perseverance began its descent into the Martian atmosphere Thursday afternoon, a process affectionately called the “<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/17/1018729/nasa-perseverance-rover-landing-searching-extraterrestrial-life-mars/\">seven minutes of terror</a>.” The spacecraft survived scorching temperatures thanks to its heat shield. Its parachute deployed without a hitch, the rover was able to locate and navigate toward a safe landing spot, and the descent apparatus lowered the spacecraft down to the surface. NASA confirmed a successful touchdown at 3:55 p.m. US Eastern time. During its descent, Perseverance went from traveling at 12,000 miles per hour to just 1.7 mph in seven minutes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of the distance between Earth and Mars, communication between NASA mission control and the spacecraft is delayed by 11 minutes. That means the entire landing process had to be accomplished autonomously. Onboard systems tracked the surface for hazards during descent and steered the rover away from any threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1321\" height=\"952\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EuiZR2xUcAMxfsq.jpeg?w=1321\" alt=\"nasa mars perseverance\" class=\"wp-image-1019143\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EuiZR2xUcAMxfsq.jpeg 1321w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EuiZR2xUcAMxfsq.jpeg?resize=300,216 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EuiZR2xUcAMxfsq.jpeg?resize=768,553 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1321px) 100vw, 1321px\" /><figcaption>The first photo taken by Perseverance from the Martian surface.</figcaption><div class=\"image-credit\">NASA</div>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What’s it doing on Mars? </strong>Perseverance’s predecessors—Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity—led to compelling revelations of what Mars currently looks like and what it once was. Scientists learned that the planet was once a warm planet teeming with lakes and rivers, and that it’s home to complex organic matter. Together, these key ingredients suggest Mars could have been habitable to microbial life in the ancient past.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Perseverance’s main goal is to look for evidence of such ancient life. The rover is armed with 23 cameras and a host of instruments designed to find and identify biosignatures (like amino acids or fatty acids) or other macroscopic evidence in rock that indicates there was once life on Mars.&nbsp;It will also drill into the Martian rock and collect samples that will be returned to Earth in the 2030s for closer laboratory study—which could be the <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/02/1017143/were-living-golden-age-sample-return-missions-mars-perseverance-moon-osiris-rex/\">first-ever sample return mission from Mars</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The landing site, Jezero crater, is a former lake bed with an ancient delta where waters may have once deposited sediments that could preserve fossilized materials or other evidence of life.&nbsp;Mission control will now spend several weeks testing and calibrating the instruments before the rover begins to explore Jezero in earnest this summer.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Teeming with new tech: </strong>Perseverance will also run some other very interesting science and tech demonstrations. A device called MOXIE will turn carbon dioxide into oxygen (and show whether we might one day be able to use this technology to sustain a Martian colony), and a small helicopter called Ingenuity could prove it’s possible to fly aerial missions on Mars and elsewhere in the solar system. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perseverance is also fitted with two microphones that will provide audio of the rover’s descent through the atmosphere as well as the sounds of the Martian landscape and wind on the surface during the mission.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Busy times at the Red Planet: </strong>Perseverance launched last summer as one of three new missions to Mars. The other two, the <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/09/1017683/hope-mars-mission-orbit-milestone-uae-space-program-united-arab-emirates/\">Hope orbiter sent by the UAE</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/23/1005557/chinas-tianwen-1-mission-is-on-its-way-to-mars/\">Tianwen-1 mission launched by China</a>, made it to Martian orbit last week.

But astronomers didn’t spot one until 1964, some 6,070 light-years away in the Cygnus constellation. Geiger counters launched into space detected cosmic x-rays coming from a region called Cygnus X-1. (We now know the cosmic rays are produced by black holes. Back then, scientists disagreed about what it was: Stephen Hawking famously bet physicist Kip Thorne that this signal was not from a black hole, but he conceded in 1990.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, some 57 years later, scientists have learned that the black hole at Cygnus X-1 is much more massive than first believed—forcing us to once again rethink how black holes form and evolve. This time, the observations were taken from Earth’s surface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“To some extent, the result was serendipitous,” says James Miller-Jones of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research at Curtin University in Australia, the lead author of<a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abb3363\">&nbsp;the new study, published in Science</a>. “We had not initially set out to remeasure the distance and black hole mass, but when we had analyzed our data, we realized its full potential.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Black holes are objects so massive that not even light, let alone physical matter, is supposed to escape its gravitational pull. Yet sometimes one inexplicably spews jets of radiation and ionized matter into space. Miller-Jones and his team wanted to investigate how matter is sucked into and expelled from black holes, so they took a closer look at Cygnus X-1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They observed the black hole for six days using the Very Long Baseline Array, a network of 10 radio telescopes sited across North America from Hawaii to the Virgin Islands. The resolution is comparable to what would be required to spot a 10-centimeter object on the moon, and it’s the same technique that the Event Horizon Telescope used to<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/04/10/136124/this-is-the-first-ever-photo-of-a-black-hole/\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/04/10/136124/this-is-the-first-ever-photo-of-a-black-hole/\">snap the first photo of a black hole</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using a combination of measurements involving radio waves and temperatures, the team modeled the precise orbits of both Cygnus X-1’s black hole and the massive supergiant star HDE 226868 (the two objects orbit each other). Knowing the orbits of each object allowed the team to extrapolate their masses—in the case of the black hole, 21 solar masses, which is about 50% more than once thought.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mass of black holes depends on a few factors, particularly the size of the star that collapsed into the black hole and the amount of mass that erodes away in the form of stellar wind. Hotter and brighter stars tend to produce more volatile stellar winds, and they also tend to be heavier. So the more massive a star is, the more prone it is to losing mass via stellar wind before and during its collapse, resulting in a lighter black hole.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in general, scientists thought stellar winds in the Milky Way were strong enough to limit the mass of black holes to no more than 15 solar masses, regardless of how big the stars were originally. The new findings clearly upend those estimates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Finding a black hole that was significantly more massive than this limit tells us that we have to revise our models of how much mass the largest stars lose in stellar winds over their lifetimes,” says Miller-Jones. It may mean the stellar winds that move through the Milky Way are less powerful than we thought, or that stars hemorrhage mass in other ways.

Although autonomous vehicles promise to significantly improve mobility, engineers must test these frameworks for critical factors such as safety and potential system failures. Toyota is one of the automakers working to make driverless systems safe. In 2016, Toyota president and CEO Akio Toyoda said more <a href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/2016/09/29/toyota-autonomous-cars-need-8-8-billion-miles-testing/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.autoblog.com/2016/09/29/toyota-autonomous-cars-need-8-8-billion-miles-testing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">testing would be needed</a> to complete its mission—some 8.8 billion miles of it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, says Stefan Jockusch, vice president of strategy at Siemens Digital Industries Software, simulation can help. By virtually testing millions of real-world scenarios, from snowy road conditions to careless pedestrians, simulation technology can analyze autonomous vehicles’ performance while accelerating development and reducing costs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But while simulation is critical to the digital development and manufacturing of today’s and tomorrow’s products, challenges such as increased complexity and a lack of domain knowledge are prompting organizations to bolster their simulation processes with artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>AI as intelligent augmenter&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although challenges can vary, Don Tolle, a director at consulting and research company CIMdata, says, “one of the key barriers to simulation is the fair amount of time it takes to turn around a complex simulation and share the results with others, including design engineers and simulation analysts.” In fact, Tolle says it can take “weeks” to design, collect information, build, execute, and analyze simulation models to support decision-making.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Complexity is another obstacle engineers must tackle. Simulation models can provide deeper and more accurate insights into the behavior of manufacturing systems—but these additional details can come at the cost of greater computation. Building simulation models also demands talent with deep domain and mathematical knowledge. Many organizations are focused on democratizing access to simulation tools by making them a standard part of design and manufacturing processes. But the challenge, warns Tolle, is “making these tools consumable by the average engineer who may not have deep domain knowledge in the specifics of a simulation and simulation technology.” After all, developing AI algorithms is only part of the simulation process; engineers need domain knowledge to understand the broader context of how the models are being built and the purpose they serve.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2271\" height=\"1877\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MIT_Siemens_ProsCons.png?w=2271\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1018657\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MIT_Siemens_ProsCons.png 2271w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MIT_Siemens_ProsCons.png?resize=300,248 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MIT_Siemens_ProsCons.png?resize=768,635 768w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MIT_Siemens_ProsCons.png?resize=1536,1270 1536w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MIT_Siemens_ProsCons.png?resize=2048,1693 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2271px) 100vw, 2271px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to the hurdles, many organizations are turning to AI to accelerate and simplify simulation—and for good reason. AI can distill information into a form that’s easier for engineers to understand and more transparent, eliminating the need to interact with every detail of a model. “The ability to create these incredibly complex models is one of the areas where artificial intelligence and machine learning will have the biggest impact,” says Tolle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s because AI can “learn” expertise from the vast volume of simulation datasets created by thousands of simulation runs in similar applications. As a result, AI can propose model parameters that allow for an optimal set of design characteristics for the system while eliminating the risk of simulation runs taking longer than physical testing. Following this, engineers can begin piecing together optimal design characteristics for more detailed designs, such as 3D computer-aided designs, software development, and electronics. “Simulation augments the intelligence of the engineer by using AI and [machine learning] to improve how we conduct analytics and use data,” says Tolle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>No shortage of use cases&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AI can help make simulation practical in cases where it otherwise wouldn’t be—for example, when a designer quickly wants to test and validate many design configurations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Simulations can be computationally expensive—for example, the charging behavior of a hybrid electric vehicle for thousands of types of drive cycles,” Jockusch says. AI helps develop so-called surrogate models, using thousands of existing simulations to derive highly simplified, computationally much less expensive models that are “accurate enough to guide designers through a complex decision space.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2362\" height=\"1116\" src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MIT_Siemens_AISimulation.png?w=2362\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1018658\" srcset=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MIT_Siemens_AISimulation.png 2362w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MIT_Siemens_AISimulation.png?resize=300,142 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MIT_Siemens_AISimulation.png?resize=768,363 768w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MIT_Siemens_AISimulation.png?resize=1536,726 1536w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MIT_Siemens_AISimulation.png?resize=2048,968 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2362px) 100vw, 2362px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another advantage of AI is its ability to detect design flaws early on in a product’s life cycle. “There have been some notable examples of system failures or system oversights in the last four or five years in both the aerospace and the automotive industries with major recalls and major problems,” says Tolle. “The cost of making decisions late in the life cycle is huge.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news, he says, is AI can minimize the risk of introducing flaws into product design by enabling engineers “to validate systems all throughout their development. This allows for smarter and faster design decisions and trade-offs early in the design life cycle rather than having to change the design later on, which can be costly in complex systems.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Download the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3qrMxC6\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://bit.ly/3qrMxC6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">full report</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This content was produced by Insights, the custom content arm of MIT Technology Review.

If you're using Maven, you can simply add:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-xml\">&lt;dependency&gt;\n    &lt;groupId&gt;com.fasterxml.jackson.module&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;jackson-module-kotlin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;2.12.1&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or, if you're using Gradle, you can add:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-groovy\">implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.module:jackson-module-kotlin:2.12.1'\n</code></pre>\n<p>With the dependency in place, let's define a JSON object we'll want to read:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n   &quot;id&quot;:101,\n   &quot;username&quot;:&quot;admin&quot;,\n   &quot;password&quot;:&quot;Admin123&quot;,\n   &quot;fullName&quot;:&quot;Best Admin&quot;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"readingajsonobjecttokotlinobject\">Reading a JSON Object to Kotlin Object</h3>\n<p>Let's take a look at how we can deserialize a JSON object into a Kotlin object. Since we'll want to convert the JSON contents into a Kotlin object, let's define a <code>User</code> data class:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-kotlin\">data class User (\n    val id: Int,\n    val username: String,\n    val password: String,\n    val fullName: String\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, we'll want to instantiate the object mapper, which can easily be done with:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-kotlin\">import com.fasterxml.jackson.module.kotlin.jacksonObjectMapper\n\n// Registering the Kotlin module with the ObjectMpper instance\nval mapper = jacksonObjectMapper()\n\n// JSON String\nval jsonString = &quot;&quot;&quot;{\n    &quot;id&quot;:101,\n    &quot;username&quot;:&quot;admin&quot;,\n    &quot;password&quot;:&quot;Admin123&quot;,\n    &quot;fullName&quot;:&quot;Best Admin&quot;\n    }&quot;&quot;&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>With that done, we can pass JSON contents into our <code>ObjectMapper</code> methods, such as <code>readValue()</code>, as usual for Jackson:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-kotlin\">// Read data from a JSON string\nval userFromJson = mapper.readValue&lt;User&gt;(jsonString)\n// Or\nval userFromJsonWithType: User = mapper.readValue(jsonString)\n</code></pre>\n<p>If we print the value of <code>userFromJson</code> we'll see something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">User(id=101, username=admin, password=Admin123, fullName=Best Admin)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>readValue()</code> function can be used with or without the <code>Class</code> parameter, as you saw a little earlier with the two variables (<code>userFromJson</code> and <code>userFromJsonWithType</code>).</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Using the function without the <code>Class</code> parameter will materialize the type and automatically create a <code>TypeReference</code> for Jackson.</p>\n<h3 id=\"writingajsonobjectfromkotlinobject\">Writing a JSON Object From Kotlin Object</h3>\n<p>Now, let's take a look at how we can serialize a Kotlin object into a JSON object.</p>\n<p>We'll use the same data class (<code>User</code>) and play a little with the features of Jackson:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-kotlin\">val user = User(102, &quot;test&quot;, &quot;pass12&quot;, &quot;Test User&quot;)\nval userJson = mapper.writeValueAsString(user)\nprintln(userJson)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, we've instantiated a new instance of the <code>User</code> class, with a few values.</p>\n<p>The <code>writeValueAsString()</code> function is our key player here and serializes any object and its fields as a String.</p>\n<p>Let's print the <code>userFromJson</code> String variable and see how it looks like:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n   &quot;id&quot;:102,\n   &quot;username&quot;:&quot;test&quot;,\n   &quot;password&quot;:&quot;pass12&quot;,\n   &quot;fullName&quot;:&quot;Test User&quot;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"writingkotlinlisttojsonarray\">Writing Kotlin List to JSON Array</h3>\n<p>Oftentimes, we're dealing with lists and arrays, rather than singular objects. Let's take a look at how we can <em>serialize a Kotlin List into a JSON array</em>.</p>\n<p>Using the same data class, we'll create a list of <code>User</code>s and serialize them into a JSON array:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-kotlin\">val userList = mutableListOf&lt;User&gt;()\nuserList.add(User(102, &quot;jsmith&quot;, &quot;P@ss&quot;, &quot;John Smith&quot;))\nuserList.add(User(103, &quot;janed&quot;, &quot;Pass1&quot;, &quot;Jane Doe&quot;))\n\nval jsonArray = mapper.writeValueAsString(userList)\nprintln(jsonArray)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This results in:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">[\n   {\n      &quot;id&quot;:102,\n      &quot;username&quot;:&quot;jsmith&quot;,\n      &quot;password&quot;:&quot;P@ss&quot;,\n      &quot;fullName&quot;:&quot;John Smith&quot;\n   },\n   {\n      &quot;id&quot;:103,\n      &quot;username&quot;:&quot;janed&quot;,\n      &quot;password&quot;:&quot;Pass1&quot;,\n      &quot;fullName&quot;:&quot;Jane Doe&quot;\n   }\n]\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"readingjsonarraytokotlinlist\">Reading JSON Array to Kotlin List</h3>\n<p>Now, let's go the other way around, and <em>deserialize a JSON array into a Kotlin List</em>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-kotlin\">val userListFromJson: List&lt;User&gt; = mapper.readValue(jsonArray)\nprintln(userListFromJson)\n</code></pre>\n<p>And this results in:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-console\">[User(id=102, username=test, password=pass12, fullName=Test User), User(id=103, username=user, password=Pass1, fullName=Demo User)]\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"handlingjsonbidirectionalrelationships\">Handling JSON Bidirectional Relationships</h3>\n<p>Another common thing to encounter is bidirectional relationships. In a lot of cases, you might want to have a one-to-many or many-to-one relationship between some objects.</p>\n<p>For this, let's create a data class <code>Author</code> which can contain one or more objects of type <code>Book</code> and the <code>Book</code> can have one <code>Author</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-kotlin\">data class Author (\n    val name: String,\n    val books: MutableList&lt;Book&gt;\n)\n\ndata class Book (\n    val title: String,\n    val author: Author\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>Author</code> contains a list, called <code>books</code>, of type <code>Book</code>. At the same time, the <code>Book</code> contains an <code>Author</code> instance.</p>\n<p>Let's make a few instances and try to serialize them:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-kotlin\">val author = Author(&quot;JK Rowling&quot;, mutableListOf())\nval bookOne = Book(&quot;Harry Potter 1&quot;, author)\nval bookTwo = Book(&quot;Harry Potter 2&quot;, author)\nauthor.books.add(bookOne)\nauthor.books.add(bookTwo)\n</code></pre>\n<p>If we were to do the same thing as before:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-kotlin\">val authors = mapper.writeValueAsString(author)\n</code></pre>\n<p>We'd quickly run into an issue:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-console\">com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonMappingException: Infinite recursion (StackOverflowError) (through reference chain: Book[&quot;author&quot;]-&gt;Author[&quot;books&quot;]-&gt;...\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>Author</code> contains the <code>Book</code>, which contains the <code>Author</code>, which contains the <code>Book</code>, which contains the <code>Author</code>, and so on, until a <code>StackOverflowError</code> is thrown.</p>\n<p>This is thankfully, easily fixable, using the <code>@JsonManagedReference</code> and <code>@JsonBackReference</code> annotations. We let Jackson know about this bidirectional relationship, that could go on forever:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-kotlin\">data class Author (\n    val name: String,\n    @JsonManagedReference\n    val books: MutableList&lt;Book&gt;\n);\n\ndata class Book (\n    val title: String,\n    @JsonBackReference\n    val author: Author\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>@JsonManagedReference</code> specifies the attribute that will be serialized normally and the <code>@JsonBackReference</code> will specify the attribute omitted from serialization. We'll effectively take out the <code>author</code> reference from the <code>Book</code> when each is serialized.</p>\n<p>Now, we can serialize the authors:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-kotlin\">val authors = mapper.writeValueAsString(author)\nprintln(authors)\n</code></pre>\n<p>If we run this code, it'll produce:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n   &quot;name&quot;:&quot;JK Rowling&quot;,\n   &quot;books&quot;:[\n      {\n         &quot;title&quot;:&quot;Harry Potter 1&quot;\n      },\n      {\n         &quot;title&quot;:&quot;Harry Potter 2&quot;\n      }\n   ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>In this tutorial, we've gone over <em>how to read and write JSON Files in Kotlin with Jackson</em>.</p>\n<p>We've gone over the required dependencies, how to serialize and deserialize JSON and Kotlin objects, as well as arrays and lists.</p>\n<p>Finally, we've covered how to handle bidirectional relationships when serializing and deserializing.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Guide to Flask-MongoEngine in Python]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this guide, we'll take a look at how to use the MongoEngine wrapper Flask-MongoEngine to integrate and create a CRUD application in Flask and Python with MongoDB.]]></description><link>https://stackabuse.com/guide-to-flask-mongoengine-in-python/</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">60245be42c5e1a08f1ec7fc9</guid><category><![CDATA[python]]></category><category><![CDATA[flask]]></category><category><![CDATA[flask-mongoengine]]></category><category><![CDATA[MongoEngine]]></category><category><![CDATA[MongoDB]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Geoffery, Joseph]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2021 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h3 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h3>\n<p>Building a web app almost always means dealing with data from a database. There are various databases to choose from, depending on your preference.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we shall be taking a look at how to integrate one of the most popular NoSQL databases - <em>MongoDB</em> - with the Flask micro-framework.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we'll be exploring how to integrate MongoDB with Flask using a popular library - <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mongoengine.org/#home\"><em><strong>MongoEngine</strong></em></a>, and more specifically, its wrapper - <em><strong>Flask-MongoEngine</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can integrate <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://stackabuse.com/integrating-mongodb-with-flask-using-flask-pymongo/\">MongoDB with Flask-PyMongo</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"flaskmongoengine\">Flask-MongoEngine</h3>\n<p>MongoEngine is an <em>ODM</em> (Object Document Mapper) that maps Python classes (models) to MongoDB documents, making it easy to create and manipulate documents programatically straight from our code.</p>\n<h4 id=\"setupandconfiguration\">Setup and Configuration</h4>\n<p>To explore some of the features of MongoEngine, we'll be creating a simple movie API that allows us to perform CRUD operations on <code>Movie</code> instances.</p>\n<p>To get started, let's install Flask if you don't have it already:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ pip install flask\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, we'll need access to a MongoDB instance, MongoDB provides a cloud instance - the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas\">MongoDB Atlas</a> - that we can use for free, however, we will be using a locally installed instance. Instructions to get and install MongoDB can be found in the <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/\">official documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>And with that done, we'll also want to install the Flask-MongoEngine library:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ pip install flask-mongoengine\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"connectingtoamongodbdatabaseinstance\">Connecting to a MongoDB Database Instance</h4>\n<p>Now that we have installed Flask and Flask-MongoEngine, we need to connect our Flask app with a MongoDB instance.</p>\n<p>We will start by importing Flask and Flask-MongoEngine into our app:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from flask import Flask\nfrom flask_mongoengine import MongoEngine\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, we can create the Flask app object:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">app = Flask(__name__)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which we'll use to initialize a <code>MongoEngine</code> object. But before the initialization is done, we'll need a reference to our MongoDB instance.</p>\n<p>This reference is a key in <code>app.config</code> whose value is a dict containing the connection parameters:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">app.config['MONGODB_SETTINGS'] = {\n    'db':'db_name',\n    'host':'localhost',\n    'port':'27017'\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We could also provide a connection URI instead:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">app.config['MONGODB_SETTINGS'] = {\n    'host':'mongodb://localhost/db_name'\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>With the configuration done, we can now initialize a <code>MongoEngine</code> object:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">db = MongoEngine(app)\n</code></pre>\n<p>We could also use the <code>init_app()</code> method of the <code>MongoEngine</code> object for the initialization:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">db = MongoEngine()\ndb.init_app(app)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once the configuration and initializations have been done, we can start exploring some of the amazing features of MongoEngine.</p>\n<h3 id=\"creatingmodelclasses\">Creating Model Classes</h3>\n<p>Being an ODM, MongoEngine uses Python classes to represent documents in our database.</p>\n<p>MongoEngine provides several types of documents classes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Document</em></li>\n<li><em>EmbeddedDocument</em></li>\n<li><em>DynamicDocument</em></li>\n<li><em>DynamicEmbeddedDocument</em></li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"document\">Document</h4>\n<p>This represents a document that has it's own collection in the database, it is created by inheriting from <code>mongoengine.Document</code> or from our <code>MongoEngine</code> instance (<code>db.Document</code>):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">class Movie(db.Document):\n    title = db.StringField(required=True)\n    year = db.IntField()\n    rated = db.StringField()\n    director = db.ReferenceField(Director)\n    cast = db.EmbeddedDocumentListField(Cast)\n    poster = db.FileField()\n    imdb = db.EmbeddedDocumentField(Imdb)\n</code></pre>\n<p>MongoEngine also provides additional classes that describe and validate the type of data a document's fields should take and optional modifiers to add more details or constraints to each field.</p>\n<p>Examples of fields are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>StringField()</code> for string values</li>\n<li><code>IntField()</code> for int values</li>\n<li><code>ListField()</code> for a list</li>\n<li><code>FloatField()</code> for floating point values</li>\n<li><code>ReferenceField()</code> for referencing other documents</li>\n<li><code>EmbeddedDocumentField()</code> for embedded documents etc.</li>\n<li><code>FileField()</code> for storing files (more on this later)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can also apply modifiers in these fields, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>required</code></li>\n<li><code>default</code></li>\n<li><code>unique</code></li>\n<li><code>primary_key</code> etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By setting any of these to <code>True</code>, they'll be applied to that field specifically.</p>\n<h4 id=\"embeddeddocument\">EmbeddedDocument</h4>\n<p>This represents a document that doesn't have it's own collection in the database but is embedded into another document, it is created by inheriting from <code>EmbeddedDocument</code> class:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">class Imdb(db.EmbeddedDocument):\n    imdb_id = db.StringField()\n    rating = db.DecimalField()\n    votes = db.IntField()\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"dynamicdocument\">DynamicDocument</h4>\n<p>This is a document whose fields are added dynamically, taking advantage of the dynamic nature of MongoDB.</p>\n<p>Like the other document types, <code>MongoEngine</code> provides a class for <code>DynamicDocument</code>s:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">class Director(db.DynamicDocument):\n    pass\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"dynamicembeddeddocument\">DynamicEmbeddedDocument</h4>\n<p>This has all the properties of <code>DynamicDocument</code> and <code>EmbeddedDocument</code></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">class Cast(db.DynamicEmbeddedDocument):\n    pass\n</code></pre>\n<p>As we are done creating all our data classes, it time to begin exploring some of the features of MongoEngine</p>\n<h3 id=\"accessingdocuments\">Accessing Documents</h3>\n<p>MongoEngine makes it very easy to query our database, we can  get all the movies in the database like so;</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from flask import jsonify\n\n@app.route('/movies')\ndef  get_movies():\n    movies = Movie.objects()\n    return  jsonify(movies), 200\n</code></pre>\n<p>If we send a GET request to:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">localhost:5000/movies/\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will return all the movies as a JSON list:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">[\n {\n     &quot;_id&quot;: {\n         &quot;$oid&quot;: &quot;600eb604b076cdbc347e2b99&quot;\n         },\n     &quot;cast&quot;: [],\n     &quot;rated&quot;: &quot;5&quot;,\n     &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Movie 1&quot;,\n     &quot;year&quot;: 1998\n },\n {\n     &quot;_id&quot;: {\n         &quot;$oid&quot;: &quot;600eb604b076cdbc347e2b9a&quot;\n         },\n     &quot;cast&quot;: [],\n     &quot;rated&quot;: &quot;4&quot;,\n     &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Movie 2&quot;,\n     &quot;year&quot;: 1999\n }\n]\n</code></pre>\n<p>When you're dealing with large results from queries like these, you'll want to truncate them and allow the end-user to slowly load in more as required.</p>\n<p>Flask-MongoEngine allows us to paginate the results very easily:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">@app.route('/movies')\ndef get_movies():\n    page = int(request.args.get('page',1))\n    limit = int(request.args.get('limit',10))\n    movies = Movie.objects.paginate(page=page, per_page=limit)\n    return jsonify([movie.to_dict() for movie in movies.items]), 200\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>Movie.objects.paginate(page=page, per_page=limit)</code> returns a <code>Pagination</code> object which contains the list of movies in its <code>.items</code> property, iterating through the property, we get our movies on the selected page:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">[\n    {\n        &quot;_id&quot;: {\n            &quot;$oid&quot;: &quot;600eb604b076cdbc347e2b99&quot;\n        },\n        &quot;cast&quot;: [],\n        &quot;rated&quot;: &quot;5&quot;,\n        &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Back to The Future III&quot;,\n        &quot;year&quot;: 1998\n    },\n    {\n        &quot;_id&quot;: {\n            &quot;$oid&quot;: &quot;600fb95dcb1ba5529bbc69e8&quot;\n        },\n        &quot;cast&quot;: [],\n        &quot;rated&quot;: &quot;4&quot;,\n        &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Spider man&quot;,\n        &quot;year&quot;: 2004\n    },\n...\n]\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"gettingonedocument\">Getting One Document</h4>\n<p>We can retrieve a single <code>Movie</code> result by passing the id as a parameter to the <code>Movie.objects()</code> method:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">@app.route('/movies/&lt;id&gt;')\ndef get_one_movie(id: str):\n    movie = Movie.objects(id=id).first()\n    return jsonify(movie), 200\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>Movie.objects(id=id)</code> will return a set of all movies whose <code>id</code> matches the parameter and <code>first()</code> returns the first <code>Movie</code> object in the queryset, if there are multiple ones.</p>\n<p>If we send a GET request to:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">localhost:5000/movies/600eb604b076cdbc347e2b99\n</code></pre>\n<p>We'll get this result:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">{\n    &quot;_id&quot;: {\n        &quot;$oid&quot;: &quot;600eb604b076cdbc347e2b99&quot;\n    },\n    &quot;cast&quot;: [],\n    &quot;rated&quot;: &quot;5&quot;,\n    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Back to The Future III&quot;,\n    &quot;year&quot;: 1998\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>For most use-cases, we would want to raise a <code>404_NOT_FOUND</code> error if no document matches the provided <code>id</code>. Flask-MongoEngine has got us covered with its <code>first_or_404()</code> and <code>get_or_404()</code> custom querysets:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">@app.route('/movies/&lt;id&gt;')\ndef get_one_movie(id: str):\n    movie = Movie.objects.first_or_404(id=id)\n    return movie.to_dict(), 200\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"creatingsavingdocuments\">Creating/Saving Documents</h3>\n<p>MongoEngine makes it super easy to create new documents using our models. All we need to do is call the <code>save()</code> method on our model class instance as below:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">@app.route('/movies/', methods=[&quot;POST&quot;])\ndef add_movie():\n    body = request.get_json()\n    movie = Movie(**body).save()\n    return jsonify(movie), 201\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>**body</code> unpacks the <code>body</code> dictionary into the <code>Movie</code> object as named parameters. For example if <code>body = {&quot;title&quot;: &quot;Movie Title&quot;, &quot;year&quot;: 2015}</code>,<br>\nThen <code>Movie(**body)</code> is the same as <code>Movie(title=&quot;Movie Title&quot;, year=2015)</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If we send this request to <code>localhost:5000/movies/</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ curl -X POST -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \\\n    -d '{&quot;title&quot;: &quot;Spider Man 3&quot;, &quot;year&quot;: 2009, &quot;rated&quot;: &quot;5&quot;}' \\\n    localhost:5000/movies/\n</code></pre>\n<p>It will save and return the document:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">{\n  &quot;_id&quot;: {\n    &quot;$oid&quot;: &quot;60290817f3918e990ba24f14&quot;\n  }, \n  &quot;cast&quot;: [], \n  &quot;director&quot;: {\n    &quot;$oid&quot;: &quot;600fb8138724900858706a56&quot;\n  }, \n  &quot;rated&quot;: &quot;5&quot;, \n  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Spider Man 3&quot;, \n  &quot;year&quot;: 2009\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"creatingdocumentswithembeddeddocuments\">Creating Documents with <em>EmbeddedDocuments</em></h4>\n<p>To add an embedded document, we first need to create the document to embed, then assign it to the appropriate field in our movie model:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">@app.route('/movies-embed/', methods=[&quot;POST&quot;])\ndef add_movie_embed():\n    # Created Imdb object\n    imdb = Imdb(imdb_id=&quot;12340mov&quot;, rating=4.2, votes=7.9)\n    body = request.get_json()\n    # Add object to movie and save\n    movie = Movie(imdb=imdb, **body).save()\n    return jsonify(movie), 201\n</code></pre>\n<p>If we send this request:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ curl -X POST -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot;\\\n    -d '{&quot;title&quot;: &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;year&quot;: 2016, &quot;rated&quot;: &quot;yes&quot;}'\\\n    localhost:5000/movies-embed/\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will return the newly added document with the embedded document:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">{\n   &quot;_id&quot;: {\n       &quot;$oid&quot;: &quot;601096176cc65fa421dd905d&quot;\n   },\n   &quot;cast&quot;: [],\n   &quot;imdb&quot;: {\n       &quot;imdb_id&quot;: &quot;12340mov&quot;,\n       &quot;rating&quot;: 4.2,\n       &quot;votes&quot;: 7\n   },\n   &quot;rated&quot;: &quot;yes&quot;,\n   &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Batman&quot;,\n   &quot;year&quot;: 2016\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"creatingdynamicdocuments\">Creating Dynamic Documents</h4>\n<p>As no fields were defined in the model, we will need to provide any arbitrary set of fields to our dynamic document object.</p>\n<p>You can put in any number of fields here, of any type. You don't even have to have the field types be uniform between multiple documents.</p>\n<p>There are a few ways to achieve this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We could create the document object with all the fields we want to add as though a request like we've done so far:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">@app.route('/director/', methods=['POST'])\ndef add_dir():\n    body = request.get_json()\n    director = Director(**body).save()\n    return jsonify(director), 201\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We could create the object first, then add the fields using the dot notation and call the save method when we are done:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">@app.route('/director/', methods=['POST'])\ndef add_dir():\n    body = request.get_json()\n    director = Director()\n    director.name = body.get(&quot;name&quot;)\n    director.age = body.get(&quot;age&quot;)\n    director.save()\n    return jsonify(director), 201\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>And finally, we could use the Python <code>setattr()</code> method:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">@app.route('/director/', methods=['POST'])\ndef add_dir():\n    body = request.get_json()\n    director = Director()\n    setattr(director, &quot;name&quot;, body.get(&quot;name&quot;))\n    setattr(director, &quot;age&quot;, body.get(&quot;age&quot;))\n    director.save()\n    return jsonify(director), 201\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In any case, we can add any set of fields, as a <code>DynamicDocument</code> implementation doesn't define any itself.</p>\n<p>If we send a POST request to <code>localhost:5000/director/</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ curl -X POST -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot;\\\n    -d '{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;James Cameron&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 57}'\\\n    localhost:5000/director/\n</code></pre>\n<p>This results in:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  &quot;_id&quot;: {\n    &quot;$oid&quot;: &quot;6029111e184c2ceefe175dfe&quot;\n  }, \n  &quot;age&quot;: 57, \n  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;James Cameron&quot;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"updatingdocuments\">Updating Documents</h3>\n<p>To update a document, we retrieve the persistent document from the database, update its fields and call the <code>update()</code> method on the modified object in memory:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">@app.route('/movies/&lt;id&gt;', methods=['PUT'])\ndef update_movie(id):\n    body = request.get_json()\n    movie = Movie.objects.get_or_404(id=id)\n    movie.update(**body)\n    return jsonify(str(movie.id)), 200\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let's send an update request:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ curl -X PUT -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot;\\\n    -d '{&quot;year&quot;: 2016}'\\\n    localhost:5000/movies/600eb609b076cdbc347e2b9a/\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will return the id of the updated document:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">&quot;600eb609b076cdbc347e2b9a&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>We could also update many documents at once using the <code>update()</code> method. We just query the database for the documents we intend to update, given some condition, and call the update method on the resulting Queryset:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">@app.route('/movies_many/&lt;title&gt;', methods=['PUT'])\ndef update_movie_many(title):\n    body = request.get_json()\n    movies = Movie.objects(year=year)\n    movies.update(**body)\n    return jsonify([str(movie.id) for movie in movies]), 200\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let's send an update request:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ curl -X PUT -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot;\\\n    -d '{&quot;year&quot;: 2016}'\\\n    localhost:5000/movies_many/2010/\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will return a list of IDs of the updated documents:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">[\n  &quot;60123af478a2c347ab08c32b&quot;, \n  &quot;60123b0989398f6965f859ab&quot;, \n  &quot;60123bfe2a91e52ba5434630&quot;, \n  &quot;602907f3f3918e990ba24f13&quot;, \n  &quot;602919f67e80d573ad3f15e4&quot;\n]\n\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"deletingdocuments\">Deleting Documents</h3>\n<p>Much like the <code>update()</code> method, the <code>delete()</code> method deletes an object, based on its <code>id</code> field:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">@app.route('/movies/&lt;id&gt;', methods=['DELETE'])\ndef delete_movie(id):\n    movie = Movie.objects.get_or_404(id=id)\n    movie.delete()\n    return jsonify(str(movie.id)), 200\n</code></pre>\n<p>Of course, since we might not have a guarantee that an object with the given ID is present in the database, we use the <code>get_or_404()</code> method to retrieve it, before calling <code>delete()</code>.</p>\n<p>Let's send a delete request:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ curl -X DELETE -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot;\\\n    localhost:5000/movies/600eb609b076cdbc347e2b9a/\n</code></pre>\n<p>This results in:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">&quot;600eb609b076cdbc347e2b9a&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>We could also delete many documents at once, to do this, we would query the database for the documents we want to delete, and then call the <code>delete()</code> method on the resulting Queryset.</p>\n<p>For example to delete all movies made in a certain year, we'd do something like the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">@app.route('/movies/delete-by-year/&lt;year&gt;/', methods=['DELETE'])\ndef delete_movie_by_year(year):\n    movies = Movie.objects(year=year)\n    movies.delete()\n    return jsonify([str(movie.id) for movie in movies]), 200\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let's send a delete request, deleting all movie entries for the year <code>2009</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ curl -X DELETE -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; localhost:5000/movies/delete-by-year/2009/\n</code></pre>\n<p>This results in:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">[\n  &quot;60291fdd4756f7031638b703&quot;, \n  &quot;60291fde4756f7031638b704&quot;, \n  &quot;60291fdf4756f7031638b705&quot;\n]\n\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"workingwithfiles\">Working with Files</h3>\n<h4 id=\"creatingandstoringfiles\">Creating and Storing Files</h4>\n<p>MongoEngine makes it very easy to interface with the MongoDB GridFS for storing and retrieving files. MongoEngine achieves this through its <code>FileField()</code>.</p>\n<p>Let's take a look at how we can upload a file to MongoDB GridFS using MongoEngine:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">@app.route('/movies_with_poster', methods=['POST'])\ndef add_movie_with_image():\n    # 1\n    image = request.files['file']\n    # 2\n    movie = Movie(title = &quot;movie with poster&quot;, year=2021)\n    # 3\n    movie.poster.put(image, filename=image.filename)\n    # 4\n    movie.save()\n    # 5\n    return jsonify(movie), 201\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let's go through the above block, line by line:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We first get an image from the key <code>file</code> in <code>request.files</code></li>\n<li>Next we create a <code>Movie</code> object</li>\n<li>Unlike other fields, we can't assign a value to the <code>FileField()</code> using the regular assignment operator, instead, we'll use the <code>put()</code> method to send our image. The <code>put()</code> method takes as arguments the file to be uploaded (this must be a file-like object or a byte stream), the filename, and optional metadata.</li>\n<li>To save our file, we call the <code>save()</code> method on the movie object, as usual.</li>\n<li>We return the <code>movie</code> object with an id referencing the image:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">{\n  &quot;_id&quot;: {\n      &quot;$oid&quot;: &quot;60123e4d2628f541032a0900&quot;\n  },\n  &quot;cast&quot;: [],\n  &quot;poster&quot;: {\n      &quot;$oid&quot;: &quot;60123e4d2628f541032a08fe&quot;\n  },\n  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;movie with poster&quot;,\n  &quot;year&quot;: 2021\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see from the JSON response, the file is actually saved as a separate MongoDB document, and we just have a database reference to it.</p>\n<h4 id=\"retrievingfiles\">Retrieving Files</h4>\n<p>Once we've <code>put()</code> a file into a <code>FileField()</code>, we can <code>read()</code> it back into memory, once we've got an object containing that field. Let's take a look at how we can retrieve files from MongoDB documents:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from io import BytesIO \nfrom flask.helpers import send_file\n\n@app.route('/movies_with_poster/&lt;id&gt;/', methods=['GET'])\ndef get_movie_image(id):\n    \n    # 1\n    movie = Movie.objects.get_or_404(id=id)\n    # 2\n    image = movie.poster.read()\n    content_type = movie.poster.content_type\n    filename = movie.poster.filename\n    # 3\n    return send_file(\n        # 4\n        BytesIO(image), \n        attachment_filename=filename, \n        mimetype=content_type), 200\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let's take a look at what's done in segments:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We retrieved the movie document containing an image.</li>\n<li>We then saved the image as a string of bytes to the <code>image</code> variable, got the filename and content type and saved those into the <code>filename</code> and <code>content_type</code> variables.</li>\n<li>Using Flask's <code>send_file()</code> helper method, we try to send the file to the user but since the image is a <code>bytes</code> object, we'd get an <code>AttributeError: 'bytes' object has no attribute 'read'</code> as <code>send_file()</code> is expecting a file-like object, not bytes.</li>\n<li>To solve this problem, we use the <code>BytesIO()</code> class from the <code>io</code> module to decode the bytes object back into a file-like object that <code>send_file()</code> can send.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"deletingfiles\">Deleting Files</h4>\n<p>Deleting documents containing files will not delete the file from GridFS, as they're stored as separate objects.</p>\n<p>To delete the documents and their accompanying files we must first delete the file before deleting the document.</p>\n<p><code>FileField()</code> also provides a <code>delete()</code> method that we can use to simply delete it from the database and file system, before we go ahead with the deletion of the object itself:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">@app.route('/movies_with_poster/&lt;id&gt;/', methods=['DELETE'])\ndef delete_movie_image(id):\n    movie = Movie.objects.get_or_404(id=id)\n    movie.poster.delete()\n    movie.delete()\n    return &quot;&quot;, 204\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>MongoEngine provides a relatively simple but feature-rich Pythonic interface for interacting with MongoDB from a python application and the Flask-MongoEngine makes it even easier to integrate MongoDB into our Flask apps.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we have explored some of the features of MongoEngine and its Flask extension.

The main motivation behind YAML is that it is designed to be in a format which is humanly friendly. With a glance we can get an understanding of the properties and their respective values, and also the relationship between properties if it exists.</p>\n<p>As the YAML files are now being frequently used, almost in every other project we come across a scenario where we have to manage data in YAML files through our code. There are a lot of open-source libraries available for handling YAML files in Java.</p>\n<p>To achieve this, we can use either of the two popular libraries: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://stackabuse.com/reading-and-writing-yaml-files-in-java-with-jackson/\">Jackson</a> or <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bitbucket.org/asomov/snakeyaml/wiki/Home\">SnakeYAML</a>.</p>\n<p>In this article, we'll be focusing on <em>How to Read and Write YAML Files in Java with SnakeYAML</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"snakeyaml\">SnakeYAML</h3>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bitbucket.org/asomov/snakeyaml\">SnakeYAML</a> is a YAML-parsing library with a high-level API for serialization and deserialization of YAML documents.</p>\n<p>The entry point for SnakeYAML is the <code>Yaml</code> class, similar to how the <code>ObjectMapper</code> class is the entry point in <em>Jackson</em>.</p>\n<p>Loading documents can be done for individual documents via the <code>load()</code> method, or in batch via the <code>loadAll()</code> method. The methods accept an <code>InputStream</code>, which is a common format to encounter files in, as well as <code>String</code> objects containing valid YAML data.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, we can <code>dump()</code> Java objects into YAML documents with ease - where the keys/fields and values are mapped into a document.</p>\n<p>Naturally, SnakeYAML works well with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://stackabuse.com/java-collections-the-map-interface/\">Java Maps</a>, given the <code>&lt;key&gt;:&lt;value&gt;</code> structure, however, you can work with custom Java objects as well.</p>\n<p>If you're using Maven, install SnakeYAML by adding the following dependency:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-xml\">&lt;dependency&gt;\n    &lt;groupId&gt;org.yaml&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;snakeyaml&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;${org.snakeyaml.version}&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>And if you're using <em>Gradle</em>, installing SnakeYAML is as simple as including the following in your Gradle file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-groovy\">compile group: 'org.yaml', name: 'snakeyaml', version: '{version}'\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can check out the latest version of the library on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.yaml/snakeyaml\">Maven Central Repository</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"readingyamlwithsnakeyaml\">Reading YAML with SnakeYAML</h3>\n<p>SnakeYAML allows you to read a YAML file into a simple <code>Map</code> object or parse the file and convert it into a custom Java object. Depending on your requirements you can decide in which format you want to read your YAML files. Let's take a look at both approaches.</p>\n<h4 id=\"readyamlfileasmapinjava\">Read YAML File as Map in Java</h4>\n<p>Let's start by reading a simple YAML file as a set of key-value pairs. The file we will be reading will have the following data:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">id: 20\nname: Bruce\nyear: 2020\naddress: Gotham City\ndepartment: Computer Science\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let's assume that we have this YAML in our Java project's resources folder. Let's load the file in as an <code>InputStream</code> first.</p>\n<p>Then, we'll construct the <code>Yaml</code> instance, which is the entry point to using the library. The <code>Yaml</code> instance introduces us to methods, such as <code>load()</code> which allow us to read and parse any <code>InputStream</code>, <code>Reader</code> or <code>String</code> with valid YAML data:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(new File(&quot;student.yml&quot;));\n\nYaml yaml = new Yaml();\nMap&lt;String, Object&gt; data = yaml.load(inputStream);\nSystem.out.println(data);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The method returns a Java <code>Map</code> in which the name of the properties are used as keys against their respective values.</p>\n<p>Note that the values in the <code>Map</code> are of type <code>Object</code>, because in a YAML file - we can have our data as string values, numbers or even collections. All of these can be fit into an <code>Object</code> so it encompasses any value we might put in.</p>\n<p>If we print our <code>data</code> object in which we have loaded the YAML file we will get the following result:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">{id=20, name=Bruce, year=2020, address=Gotham City, department=Computer Science}\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see that the properties from YAML file are simple mapped as key-value pairs in a java Map object.</p>\n<p>Lets update our YAML file to to contain collection data as well. The update YAML file look like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">id: 20\nname: Bruce\nyear: 2020\naddress: Gotham City\ndepartment: Computer Science\ncourses:\n  - name: Algorithms\n    credits: 6\n  - name: Data Structures\n    credits: 5\n  - name: Design Patterns\n    credits: 3\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now our YAML file contains a collection <code>courses</code> which has multiple data values.</p>\n<p>To read the updated YAML file there is no need to update our Java code. Our previous code will be able to successfully load the YAML file into our <code>Map</code> object. After reading the file the result be:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">{\n id=20, name=Bruce, year=2020, address=Gotham City, department=Computer Science, \n courses=[{name=Algorithms, credits=6}, {name=Data Structures, credits=5}, {name=Design Patterns, credits=3}]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The courses element in the YAML file is read as an <code>ArrayList</code> where each value in the list is a <code>Map</code> object itself.</p>\n<h4 id=\"readyamlobjectascustomjavaobject\">Read YAML Object as Custom Java Object</h4>\n<p>Now that we have successfully consumed the YAML file in our Java code as simple key-value pairs, lets load the same file as a custom Java object, which is a much more common use-case.</p>\n<p>We will use the following Java classes to load data into from our YAML files:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">public class Person {\n    private long id;\n    private String name;\n    private String address;\n    // Getters and setters\n}\n\npublic class Student extends Person {\n    private int year;\n    private String department;\n    private List&lt;Course&gt; courses;\n    // Getters and setters\n}\n\npublic class Course {\n    private String name;\n    private double credits;\n    // Getters and setters\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We will load the data into a <code>Student</code> object, where the courses element from the YAML file will be converted into a <code>List</code> of type <code>Course</code>.</p>\n<p>We will use the same YAML file which we have used in the previous example and load it in as an <code>InputStream</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(new File(&quot;student_with_courses.yml&quot;));\nYaml yaml = new Yaml(new Constructor(Student.class));\nStudent data = yaml.load(inputStream);\nSystem.out.println(data);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now when we are creating our <code>Yaml</code> class object, we are specifying the data type we want to cast the data into. The <code>new Constructor(Student.class)</code> tells SnakeYAML to read the data from YAML file map it to our <code>Student</code> object.</p>\n<p>The mapping is straightforward and the names of your object attributes will have to match the names of the YAML attributes (<code>courses</code> -&gt; <code>courses</code>).</p>\n<p>This results in:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">Student[Person[id=20, name='Bruce', address='Gotham City'], year=2020, department='Computer Science', courses=[Course[name='Algorithms', credits=6.0], Course[name='Data Structure', credits=5.0], Course[name='Design patters', credits=3.0]]]\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see SnakeYAML has successfully created the <code>Student</code> object while keeping the <code>Student</code> class inheritance (Parent class <code>Person</code>) and association with the <code>Course</code> class intact.</p>\n<h3 id=\"writingyamlwithsnakeyaml\">Writing YAML with SnakeYAML</h3>\n<p>Now that we have successfully read YAML files in our Java code, lets start writing data into YAML files using our Java project. Similar to reading YAML documents, we can write simple Java <code>Map</code> and a custom Java object into a YAML file.</p>\n<h4 id=\"writemapintoyaml\">Write Map Into YAML</h4>\n<p>Lets first write a simple <code>Map</code> object to a YAML file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">Map&lt;String, Object&gt; dataMap = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\ndataMap.put(&quot;id&quot;, 19);\ndataMap.put(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;John&quot;);\ndataMap.put(&quot;address&quot;, &quot;Star City&quot;);\ndataMap.put(&quot;department&quot;, &quot;Medical&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, let's create a new <code>PrintWriter</code> object, with the output directory in mind, and <code>dump()</code> the <code>dataMap</code> using that writer.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>dump()</code> method accepts <em>any</em> <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/Writer.html\">Writer</a>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new File(&quot;./src/main/resources/student_output.yml&quot;));\nYaml yaml = new Yaml();\nyaml.dump(dataMap, writer);\n</code></pre>\n<p>This results in a file that contains:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">{address: Star City, name: John, id: 19, department: Medical}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> is that the output YAML file does not have the values in the same sequence in which we added them in our Java <code>Map</code> object, since we've used a <code>HashMap</code> which doesn't preserve the order of entry.</p>\n<p>You can fix this issue by using a <code>LinkedHashMap</code> instead.</p>\n<h4 id=\"writecustomjavaobjectintoyaml\">Write Custom Java Object into YAML</h4>\n<p>Now lets try and save our <code>Student</code> class in YAML format in the output file. For this we will use following code to setup the <code>Student</code> object:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">Student student = new Student();\n\nstudent.setId(21);\nstudent.setName(&quot;Tim&quot;);\nstudent.setAddress(&quot;Night City&quot;);\nstudent.setYear(2077);\nstudent.setDepartment(&quot;Cyberware&quot;);\n\nCourse courseOne = new Course();\ncourseOne.setName(&quot;Intelligence&quot;);\ncourseOne.setCredits(5);\n\nCourse courseTwo = new Course();\ncourseTwo.setName(&quot;Crafting&quot;);\ncourseTwo.setCredits(2);\n\nList&lt;Course&gt; courseList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\ncourseList.add(courseOne);\ncourseList.add(courseTwo);\n\nstudent.setCourses(courseList);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, let's use our <code>Yaml</code> instance with a <code>Writer</code> implementation to <code>dump()</code> the data into a file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new File(&quot;./src/main/resources/student_output_bean.yml&quot;));\nYaml yaml = new Yaml();\nyaml.dump(student, writer);\n</code></pre>\n<p>This results in:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">!!model.Student\naddress: Night City\ncourses:\n- {credits: 5.0, name: Intelligence}\n- {credits: 2.0, name: Crafting}\ndepartment: Cyberware\nid: 21\nname: Tim\nyear: 2077\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you take a closer look at the YAML output files generated by our code, you will see that in the first example, all the data was dumped in a single line whereas in the second example the <code>Course</code> object values are written in a single line each under the courses element.</p>\n<p>Although both the generated output files have valid YAML syntax, if you want to create a YAML file in the more commonly used format where each value is written on a single line and there are not parentheses, you can tweak the <code>DumperOptions</code> object, and pass it into the <code>Yaml</code> constructor:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">DumperOptions options = new DumperOptions();\noptions.setIndent(2);\noptions.setPrettyFlow(true);\noptions.setDefaultFlowStyle(DumperOptions.FlowStyle.BLOCK);\nYaml yaml = new Yaml(options);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, we have specified the indentation and YAML document flow using the <code>DumperOptions</code> object. Now when we use the <code>dump</code> function on the <code>Yaml</code> instance we will get differently formatted output:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">!!model.Student\naddress: Night City\ncourses:\n- credits: 5.0\n  name: Intelligence\n- credits: 2.0\n  name: Crafting\ndepartment: Cyberware\nid: 21\nname: Tim\nyear: 2077\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>As YAML files are becoming more frequent in use, especially for specifying project properties and build and deployment meta-data, it's increasingly useful to be able to handle them using code.</p>\n<p>Through SnakeYAML, we can easily manage YAML files in our Java project, and minimal amount of code is used to either load YAML files into our project or write data into YAML files. SnakeYAML also provides formatting options so you can tweak and customize to your needs.</p>\n<p>The source code for the sample code can be found on <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/TaimoorChoudhary/snake-yaml\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Get Total Size of a Directory in Linux]]></title><description><![CDATA[This articles covers the du Linux/Unix utility to get the size of a directory.

We can do better than that.</p>\n<p>If you've thought of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://stackabuse.com/graphs-in-java-dijkstras-algorithm/\">Dijkstra's algorithm</a>, points for you! That's a great algorithm for finding the shortest path and is also pretty efficient. It does the job even for huge scale calculations, such as routing across the entirety of the Internet. It's also both <em>complete</em> and <em>optimal</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So job's done, right?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Not so quickly.</em></p>\n<p>While Dijkstra may be the best possible solution for some real-world problems, it can spend a lot of time checking alternative paths, especially in a dense graph with many nodes. In fact, Dijkstra evaluates <em>every node</em> in the graph. Even the ones behind it, going away from the goal. If the goal was right in front of the current node, it'd still evaluate the nodes on the opposite side of the graph, even though it could just evaluate the intermediary nodes between itself and the goal.</p>\n<p>It's just like taking a look at the <em>entire map of the city</em> on every step you make towards a coffee shop, instead of directing your search in the general direction of the shop.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If we could somehow guide the general direction it goes in, towards the target node, we could skip a lot of unnecessary work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let's say we're able to roughly guess the distance between two nodes. Perhaps we're trying to calculate a travel path by road between two points on Earth. We could say that the straight airplane travel distance is a rough estimation of how far apart they are. What if we used this estimation to pick the next node instead of using the edge weight?</p>\n<p>That approach is called <strong>best-first search</strong> and will often increase our efficiency, but we will often end up with a suboptimal solution.</p>\n<p>That leads us to how A* manages to solve all of these problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Some refer to A* as <em>the informed Dijkstra</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"theaalgorithminjava\">The A* Algorithm in Java</h3>\n<p><strong>Starting conditions:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We have a starting node (called <code>start</code>) and a target node (called <code>target</code>).</li>\n<li>We have a weighted directed graph of <code>n</code> nodes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The goal:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find the shortest path from <code>start</code> to <code>finish</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"costfunctionfn\">Cost Function - <em>f(n)</em></h4>\n<p>We want to determine which node to move into at every step. To do that, we'll design a mathematical function <strong>f(n)</strong> which will measure how good of a candidate a node is for being included in our shortest path.</p>\n<p>This is the <em>cost function</em>, and we'll want to minimize it to produce an optimal outcome.</p>\n<p>The cost function is the sum of a <em>move function</em> and a <em>heuristic function</em>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"movefunctiongn\">Move Function - <em>g(n)</em></h4>\n<p>Because we're at node <strong>n</strong>, we know the cost it took us to get there from the <code>start</code> node. We'll call that <em>move function</em> - <strong>g(n)</strong>.</p>\n<p>If we say that <strong>f(n)=g(n)</strong> we'll create Dijkstra's algorithm. At each step, we'd be picking the the node with the lowest cost to get to from <code>start</code> - the node with the smallest value for <strong>g(n)</strong>. This means our function is lacking a &quot;guiding component&quot; so to speak.</p>\n<h4 id=\"heuristicfunctionhn\">Heuristic Function - <em>h(n)</em></h4>\n<p>We'll call this guiding component a <strong>heuristic</strong> and label it <strong>h(n)</strong>. We'll use this component to estimate how close the node we're looking at is to the <code>target</code>.</p>\n<p>This estimation is the heart and soul of A* and it will make or break any particular implementation of it, but theoretically speaking you can use any function you'd like. If we knew the <em>exact</em> distance in terms of nodes, we'd already have the optimal solution.</p>\n<p>Though, if we know the position of the target node, we can for example, calculate the Euclidean Distance between the target node and our current node. The shorter it is, the closer we are to the target node - <em><strong>roughly</strong></em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> You'll just get better results if you carefully craft your heuristic.</p>\n<h4 id=\"calculatingamoves\">Calculating A* Moves</h4>\n<p>So the final formula we get is <strong>f(n)=g(n)+h(n)</strong>. We start from the <code>start</code> node, add it to a list of open nodes. We evaluate all of the open nodes' neighbors and add them to the list of open nodes. We pick the one with the <em>lowest value</em> for <strong>f(n)</strong> and if it's not the <code>target</code> we repeat the process.</p>\n<p>The fewer steps we take from the starting point combined with how close we get to the goal makes the value of <strong>f(n)</strong> lower if we're going with the shortest path to the goal. Walking away from the goal, and making more steps than needed to get there increases the <strong>f(n)</strong> function.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you're confused a bit with the difference between <strong>g(n)</strong> and <strong>h(n)</strong>, look at it like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>g</strong> is something we can (and do) calculate at any given step, and it's the distance between <code>start</code> and <code>n</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>h</strong> is something we don't know, and need to estimate - the distance from <code>n</code> to the <code>target</code> node.</li>\n<li><strong>f</strong> is the sum of the two</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.stackabuse.com/media/articles/graphs-in-java-a-star-algorithm-2.png\" alt=\"a star cost function\"></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"apseudocode\">A* Pseudocode</h4>\n<p>We maintain two lists of nodes, an <strong>open list</strong> and a <strong>closed list</strong>.</p>\n<p>The open list contains nodes that we've encountered, but haven't analyzed yet. Initially, it only contains the <code>starting</code> node.</p>\n<p>The closed list contains nodes whose all neighbors have been added to the open list. Closed nodes have their shortest path calculated and their adjacent nodes &quot;scheduled&quot; for analysis by being added to the open list.</p>\n<p>Closed nodes can become open again if we encounter them through a different path and that path is more optimal than the one we previously used to reach them.</p>\n<p>We go through open nodes, open their neighbors, calculate their <strong>f</strong> and <strong>g</strong> and then close them again.</p>\n<p>Usually you'd need to calculate <strong>h</strong> once, the first time you encounter a node. You don't have to recalculate it multiple times because it's fixed. We've omitted that in this code, assuming the heuristic is calculated in advance, but you can add it depending on your application:</p>\n<pre>\n<code>\nmake an empty list <i>C</i> of closed nodes\nmake a list <i>O</i> of open nodes and their respective <i>f</i> values containing the start node\n<b>while</b> <i>O</i> isn't empty:\n    pick a node <i>n</i> from <i>O</i> with the best value for <i>f</i>\n    <b>if</b> <i>n</i> is target:\n        <b>return</b> solution\n    <b>for every</b> <i>m</i> which is a neighbor of <i>n</i>:\n        <b>if</b> (<i>m</i> is not in <i>C</i>) <b>and</b> (<i>m</i> is not in <i>O</i>):\n            add <i>m</i> to <i>O</i>, set <i>n</i> as <i>m</i>'s parent\n            calculate <i>g(m)</i> and <i>f(m)</i> and save them\n        <b>else</b>:\n            <b>if</b> <i>f(m)</i> from last iteration is better than <i>g(m)</i> from this iteration:\n                set <i>n</i> as <i>m</i>'s parent\n                update <i>g(m)</i> and <i>f(m)</i>\n                <b>if</b> <i>m</i> is in <i>C</i>:\n                    move <i>m</i> to <i>O</i>\n    move <i>n</i> from <i>O</i> to <i>C</i>\n\n<b>return</b> that there's no solution\n</code>\n</pre>\n<h4 id=\"aimplementationinjava\">A* Implementation in Java</h4>\n<p>We'll implement an algorithm for the graph shown in the beginning of the article.

Meaning that the following inequality is true for every node <em>n</em>:</p>\n<p>$$<br>\nh(n)\\leq h\\ ⃰(n)<br>\n$$</p>\n<p>Where <em>h</em> ⃰  is the ideal heuristic, accurately measuring the shortest path.</p>\n<p>If <em>h</em> is admissible, A* will always return the optimal path.</p>\n<p>If <em>h</em> is not admissible, but it doesn't overestimate the real distance by more than some value <em>d</em>, then the length of the path found by A* won't differ from the optimal path by more than <em>d</em>.</p>\n<p>Function <em>h(n)</em> is <strong>consistent</strong> if it evaluates to 0 for the target node and if for every two neighboring nodes it is true that:</p>\n<p>$$<br>\nc(n,m)+h(m)\\geq h(n)<br>\n$$</p>\n<p>Where <em>c(n,m)</em> is the weight of the edge <em>(n,m)</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> If a heuristic function is consistent, then it is also admissible.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://stackabuse.com/basic-ai-concepts-a-search-algorithm/#proofbycompleteinduction\">proof</a> of this theorem is done by complete induction.</p>\n<h4 id=\"complexity\">Complexity</h4>\n<p>Barring special cases, <a href=\"https://stackabuse.com/big-o-notation-and-algorithm-analysis-with-python-examples/\">complexity</a> of A* can be approximated based on the number of neighbors of every node and the length of the shortest path.

The complexity of A* is then:</p>\n<p>$$<br>\nO(b^d)<br>\n$$</p>\n<p>Exponential complexity would be no better than brute force, so this may seem bad. The thing is, we can lower this to polynomial complexity if our heuristic satisfies the following equation:</p>\n<p>$$<br>\n|h(x)-h\\ ⃰(x)| \\leq O(\\log h\\ ⃰(x))<br>\n$$</p>\n<p>A* is also <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm#Optimal_efficiency\">optimally efficient</a>, meaning that it has been proven that no complete algorithm is more efficient than A* for solving the same problem.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example2dterrainwithobstacles\">Example - 2D Terrain With Obstacles</h3>\n<p>Let's say we have a 2D grid with obstacles. Each square corresponds to one node and we can move like a king in chess - one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. We want to find the shortest path from start to target.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.stackabuse.com/media/articles/graphs-in-java-a-star-algorithm-5.png\" alt=\"2d terrain with obstacles a star java\"></p>\n<h4 id=\"representation\">Representation</h4>\n<p>In this case, we can represent our graph as a matrix of nodes, rather than using adjacency lists. Each node can have an indicator of whether it's walkable or an obstacle. We can use matrix indices to figure out adjacent nodes as well as to use them like they're coordinates when calculating our heuristic distances.</p>\n<h4 id=\"heuristic\">Heuristic</h4>\n<p>Your first thought might be using <strong>Euclidean distance</strong>. However, in large problems, this should be avoided as calculating the square root often can cause inefficiency. It's a good metric if nothing else fits the problem, but if you can get away with using a simplified distance you should try to.</p>\n<p>A second idea might be <strong>Manhattan distance</strong> (also called taxicab or city-block distance). Manhattan distance the sum of horizontal and vertical differences:</p>\n<p>$$<br>\nD_{Manhattan}(p,q)=|q_x-p_x|+|q_y-p_y|<br>\n$$</p>\n<p>However, this metric is not admissible because it often overestimates the distance. Imagine a grid with no obstacles and start and target positioned diagonally. Manhattan would always overestimate this case.</p>\n<p>A good choice, in this case, is so-called <strong>Chebyshev distance</strong>:</p>\n<p>$$<br>\nD_{Chebyshev}(p,q)=max(|q_x-p_x|,|q_y-p_y|)<br>\n$$</p>\n<p>This metric is admissible and thus guarantees an optimal solution. It's also quick to calculate, so it doesn't put a strain on resources in each iteration.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>We've taken a look at A* search algorithm and its properties. We've learned how it works and why it's very good in practice, provided that we can ensure certain properties of a heuristic guiding it.</p>\n<p>Applying this to real problems takes practice and experience, but this article should have given the reader a good foundation to start them off.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Python: Check if Variable is a Dictionary]]></title><description><![CDATA[In Python, we can use these two ways to check if a given variable is a Dictionary: the type() function and the is operator; and the isinstance() function]]></description><link>https://stackabuse.com/python-check-if-variable-is-a-dictionary/</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">6017e9952c5e1a08f1ec7af6</guid><category><![CDATA[python]]></category><category><![CDATA[data structures]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Naazneen Jatu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2021 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h3 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h3>\n<p>Variables act as a container to store data. A developer can use type hints when creating variables or passing arguments, however, that's an optional feature in Python, and many codebases, old and new, are yet to have them. It's more common for a variable in Python to have no information of the type being stored.</p>\n<p>If we had code that needed a dictionary but lacked type hints, how can we avoid errors if the variable used <em>is not</em> a dictionary?</p>\n<p>In this tutorial, we'll take a look at <em>how to check if a variable is a dictionary in Python</em>, using the <code>type()</code> and <code>isinstance()</code> functions, as well as the <code>is</code> operator:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#checkifvariableisadictionarywithtype\">Check if Variable is Dictionary with type()</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#checkifvariableisadictionarywithisoperator\"> Check if Variable is Dictionary with is Operator</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#checkifvariableisadictionarywithisinstance\">Check if Variable is Dictionary with isinstance()</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Developers usually use <code>type()</code> and <code>is</code>, though, these can be limited in certain contexts, in which case, it's better to use the <code>isinstance()</code> function.</p>\n<h3 id=\"checkifvariableisadictionarywithtype\">Check if Variable is a Dictionary with <em>type()</em></h3>\n<p>We can use the <code>type()</code> function to instantly get the type of any variable. For a variable of type <code>Dictionary</code>, it must return <code>&lt;class 'dict'&gt;</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">squares = {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9}\nprint(type(squares))\n</code></pre>\n<p>This results in:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">&lt;class 'dict'&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"checkifvariableisadictionarywithisoperator\">Check if Variable is a Dictionary with <em>is</em> Operator</h3>\n<p>In Python, <code>is</code> is an identity operator. It verifies if both the operands are identical to each other. Being identical indicates that they refer to the same memory location.</p>\n<p>We can use the <code>is</code> operator with the result of a <code>type()</code> call with a variable and the <code>dict</code> class. It will output <code>True</code> only if the <code>type()</code> points to the same memory location as the <code>dict</code> class. Otherwise, it will output <code>False</code>.</p>\n<p>As a sanity check, we can use the <code>id()</code> function to get the address of the object in memory and verify the comparison:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">squares = {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9}\nprint(type(squares) is dict)  # True\nprint(&quot;memory address of type(squares):&quot;, id(type(squares)))\nprint(&quot;memory address of dict:&quot;, id(dict))  # Should have same ID as type(squares)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This code will produce the following output on a Python interpreter:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">True\nmemory address of type(squares): 1609576584\nmemory address of dict: 1609576584\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The memory address may vary for you, but the same ID should be present for both the <code>type(squares)</code> and <code>dict</code>.</p>\n<p>One caveat of this method is that it fails to work if the variable is a type that's a subclass of <code>dict</code>. For example, the previous code would not work if the <code>squares</code> variable was an <em>Ordered Dictionary</em> instead:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from collections import OrderedDict\n\nsquares = OrderedDict([(1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9)])\nprint(type(squares) is dict)  # False\nprint(&quot;memory address of type(squares):&quot;, id(type(squares)))\nprint(&quot;memory address of dict:&quot;, id(dict))  # Different ID as they're different classes\n</code></pre>\n<p>This outputs:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">False\nmemory address of type(squares): 9464512\nmemory address of dict: 9481952\n</code></pre>\n<p>If your code is required to work on subclasses of Dictionaries, then you would prefer to use the <code>isinstance()</code> method.</p>\n<h3 id=\"checkifvariableisadictionarywithisinstance\">Check if Variable is a Dictionary with <em>isinstance()</em></h3>\n<p>As we have seen that the <code>is</code> operator will return <code>True</code> when the memory address of both the objects is the same. If we have a Dictionary of type inherited from class <code>dict</code>, it will return <code>False</code>. For example, a Dictionary of a subclass of <code>dict</code> like <code>OrderedDict</code> or <code>defaultdict</code> will not point to the same memory address as of <code>dict</code>.</p>\n<p>Here we have the <code>isinstance()</code> function to the rescue. This function takes two arguments; an object and a class. If the object is an instance of the class or its subclasses, it will return <code>True</code>. If the object is not an instance of the given class, whether direct or indirect, it returns <code>False</code>.</p>\n<p>Here is a code example to check if the variable is a Dictionary using the <code>isinstance()</code> function:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from collections import OrderedDict\n\n# Variable of type dict\nsquares = {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9}\nprint(isinstance(squares, dict))  # True\n\n# Variable of type OrderedDict (Subclass of dict)\ncubes = OrderedDict(((1, 1), (2, 8)))\nprint(isinstance(cubes, dict))  # True\n</code></pre>\n<p>This code will produce the following output on a Python interpreter:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">True\nTrue\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>This tutorial showed ways in which we can check if a variable is a Dictionary. We have first seen the <code>type()</code> function which outputs <code>&lt;class 'dict'&gt;</code> for any Dictionary object. Then we have seen the use of the <code>is</code> operator to check if the type of variable points to <code>dict</code> in the memory location. This returns <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> accordingly.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we have seen that <code>is</code> fails at identifying inherited Dictionary objects. When we want to capture inherited objects, we can use the <code>isinstance()</code> function. It returns <code>True</code> if the object is directly or indirectly an instance of the given class (<code>dict</code> in this article), and <code>False</code> otherwise.</p>\n<p>As both these methods return <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>, we can easily use them in conditional statements. Unless you explicitly want to reject subclasses of <code>dict</code>, the <code>isinstance()</code> function is the most reliable way to check if a variable is a Dictionary.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Python: Get Number of Days Between Dates]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this tutorial, we'll go over how to get the number of days between two dates in Python, using the datetime module and timedelta objects, as well as add and subtract fixed timeframes.]]></description><link>https://stackabuse.com/python-get-number-of-days-between-dates/</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">601846b52c5e1a08f1ec7b96</guid><category><![CDATA[python]]></category><category><![CDATA[datetime]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Spencer Porter]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 15 Feb 2021 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h3 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h3>\n<p>In this tutorial, we'll take a look at <em>how to get the number of days between two dates in Python</em>.</p>\n<p>We'll be using the built-in <code>datetime</code> package, that allows you to really easily work with <code>datetime</code> objects in Python.</p>\n<h3 id=\"creatingadatetimeobject\">Creating a Datetime Object</h3>\n<p>As datetime is a built-in module, you can access it right away by importing it at the top of your Python file.</p>\n<p>You can construct <code>datetime</code> objects in a few different ways:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from datetime import datetime\n\ndate_string = &quot;1 January, 2021&quot;\n\nnow = datetime.now() # Create Datetime based on system clock\ndt1 = datetime(day=1, month=1, year=2021) # Create Datetime with given arguments\ndt2 = datetime.strptime(date_string, &quot;%d %B, %Y&quot;) # Create Datetime from String\n</code></pre>\n<p>There are certain rules to follow when it comes to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://stackabuse.com/converting-strings-to-datetime-in-python/\">Converting Strings to Datetime in Python</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"getnumberofdaysbetweendatesinpython\">Get Number of Days Between Dates in Python</h3>\n<p>Trying to measure the numbers of days between dates without using the datetime module is a <em>deceptively complex</em> task - between accounting for leap years and the number of days in each month, trying to create your own implementation is nonsensical.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With <code>datetime</code> however, it becomes trivial.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can simply <em>subtract</em> a <code>date</code> or <code>datetime</code> from each other, to get the number of days between them:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from datetime import datetime\n\ndate1 = datetime.now()\ndate2 = datetime(day=1, month=7, year=2021)\n\ntimedelta = date2 - date1\nprint(timedelta)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This returns a <code>timedelta</code> object, which contains <code>days</code>, <code>seconds</code> and <code>microseconds</code> and represents the duration between any two <code>date</code>/<code>time</code> or <code>datetime</code> objects.</p>\n<p>Printing this object will return the days, hours, minutes, seconds and microseconds to that event:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">149 days, 5:22:52.255124\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you're not interested in some of these metrics, you can specify which of them you'd like to access with <code>timedelta.days</code>, <code>timedelta.seconds</code> and <code>timedelta.microseconds</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">now = datetime.now()\nnew_years = datetime(day=1, month=1, year=2022)\ncountdown = new_years - now\n\nprint('Today is: ', now)\nprint('New Year is on: ', new_years)\nprint('Days until New Years: ', countdown.days)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, we've assigned the days between <code>now</code> and <code>new_years</code> into <code>countdown</code>, which is a <code>timedelta</code> object.</p>\n<p>Then, we can simply access the <code>days</code> parameter of that object to get the number of days between them.

This can be done with the <code>pop()</code> function, the <code>del</code> keyword, and with dict comprehensions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"removeakeyusingpopkeyd\">Remove a Key Using <em>pop(key,d)</em></h3>\n<p>The <code>pop(key, d)</code> function removes a key from a dictionary and returns its value. It takes two arguments, the key is removed and the optional value to return if the key isn't found. Here's an example of popping an element with only the required <code>key</code> argument:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">my_dict = {1: &quot;a&quot;, 2: &quot;b&quot;}\npopped_value = my_dict.pop(1)\n\nline = &quot;The value removed from the dictionary of the key: 1 is {}&quot;\nprint(line.format(popped_value))\n</code></pre>\n<p>This snippet returns the following output:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">The value removed from the dictionary of the key: 1 is a\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, observe what happens when we try to remove a key that doesn't exist:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">my_dict = {1: &quot;a&quot;, 2: &quot;b&quot;}\npopped_value = my_dict.pop(3)\n\nline = &quot;The value removed from the dictionary of the key: 3 is {}&quot;\nprint(line.format(popped_value))\n</code></pre>\n<p>This raises a <em>KeyError</em>, as expected since it doesn't exist:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\nKeyError: 3\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you call <code>pop()</code> on a key that doesn't exist, Python would return a <code>KeyError</code>. So only use <code>pop(key)</code> if you're confident that the key exists in the dictionary.</p>\n<p>If you are unsure if the key exists then put a value for the second, optional argument for <code>pop()</code> - the default value. Instead of throwing a <em>KeyError</em> it will return that value.</p>\n<p>The above snippet can be rewritten as:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">my_dict = {1: &quot;a&quot;, 2: &quot;b&quot;}\nremoved_value = my_dict.pop(3, None)\n\nline = &quot;The value removed from the dictionary of the key: 3 is {}&quot;\nprint(line.format(removed_value))\n</code></pre>\n<p>And now it doesn't throw an error when we run it:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">The value removed from the dictionary of the key: 3 is None\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"removeakeyusingdeldictkey\">Remove a Key Using <em>del dict[key]</em></h3>\n<p>Another way to remove a key from a dictionary is through the <code>del</code> keyword. This keyword can remove any object. It can also delete a key-value pair of a dictionary like this: <code>del dict_name[key]</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">my_dict = {1: &quot;a&quot;, 2: &quot;b&quot;}\ndel my_dict[1]\n\nline = &quot;The dictionary after deletion is {}&quot;\nprint(line.format(my_dict))\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above snippet returns the following output, denoting the dictionary with just the left out value(s):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">The dictionary after deletion is {2: 'b'}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Unlike <code>pop()</code>, no value is returned when deleted. If you are looking to preserve the existing dictionary input, you can find the next section to be useful.</p>\n<h3 id=\"removemultipledictionarykeyswithdictcomprehensions\">Remove Multiple Dictionary Keys with Dict Comprehensions</h3>\n<p>The previous methods update a dictionary in-place, meaning that the key-value pair is destroyed. If the original key needs to be preserved, we can use a custom function to do so. In Python, it's commonly known that we can use list comprehensions to create a new list based on an existing one. We can do the same with dictionaries using dict comprehensions.</p>\n<p>So instead of deleting values in a list, we can use a dict comprehension to create a new dictionary with a condition that excludes the values we don't want.</p>\n<p>Take the following example where we create a new dictionary that doesn't have a key of <code>1</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">my_dict = {1: &quot;a&quot;, 2: &quot;b&quot;}\nmy_dict2 = {k: v for k, v in my_dict.items() if k != 1}\n\nline = &quot;The new dictionary is {}&quot;\nprint(line.format(my_dict2))\n</code></pre>\n<p>This snippet generates the following output, printing the new dictionary:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">The new dictionary is {2: 'b'}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that we're creating a new dictionary, adding to our program's memory usage. For dictionaries of bigger sizes, if we don't exclude a lot of members then we're nearly doubling the memory used for that data.</p>\n<h3 id=\"benchmarkingfunctionefficiency\">Benchmarking Function Efficiency</h3>\n<p>We have observed three methods so far. But which method is the fastest among the three?</p>\n<p>Let's create a random dictionary on which we will be testing out our methods. The following function <code>gen_random_dict(n)</code> takes a list as an argument and creates a dictionary with random seeded integers:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">import random\n\ndef gen_random_dict(n):\n    random.seed(0)\n    mydict = {}\n    for i in range(n):\n        nmbr = random.randrange(1, n, 1)\n        mydict[nmbr] = &quot;value &quot;+ str(nmbr)\n    return mydict\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this same file, let's add some functions that delete a key in each of the ways we discussed:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># Remove a key using pop function\ndef remove_using_pop(dict_input):\n    dict_input.pop(1)\n    return None\n\n\n# Remove a key using del keyword\ndef remove_using_del(dict_input):\n    del dict_input[1]\n    return None\n\n\n# Remove a key using condition\ndef remove_using_condition(dict_input):\n    return {k: v for k, v in dict_input.items() if k != 1}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finally, add the following code that uses the <code>timeit</code> module that measures the execution time of our code:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">import timeit\n\n\nif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\n    func_to_be_tested = &quot;remove_using_pop(gen_random_dict(10000))&quot;\n    setup_stmt = &quot;from __main__ import remove_using_pop, gen_random_dict&quot;\n    runtime1 = timeit.timeit(func_to_be_tested, setup=setup_stmt, number=1)\n    func_to_be_tested = &quot;remove_using_del(gen_random_dict(10000))&quot;\n    setup_stmt = &quot;from __main__ import remove_using_del, gen_random_dict&quot;\n    runtime2 = timeit.timeit(func_to_be_tested, setup=setup_stmt, number=1)\n    func_to_be_tested = &quot;remove_using_condition(gen_random_dict(10000))&quot;\n    setup_stmt = &quot;from __main__ import remove_using_condition, gen_random_dict&quot;\n    runtime3 = timeit.timeit(func_to_be_tested, setup=setup_stmt, number=1)\n    print(&quot;Runtime for removing key from Dict:&quot;)\n    print(&quot;\\t1) Using Pop: {}&quot;.format(str(runtime1)))\n    print(&quot;\\t2) Using Del: {}&quot;.format(str(runtime2)))\n    print(&quot;\\t3) Using Condition: {}&quot;.format(str(runtime3)))\n</code></pre>\n<p>While results may vary on your computer, the pattern should be consistent. Here's the output we got after executing this script:</p>\n<pre><code>Runtime for removing key from Dict:\n        1) Using Pop: 0.015606499999194057\n        2) Using Del: 0.01090950000070734\n        3) Using Condition: 0.011443700001109391\n</code></pre>\n<p>Using the <code>del</code> keyword has an edge over the rest of the methods. Although the time difference doesn't seem to be very dramatic on smaller dictionaries. Though, it will make a huge impact when the size of the dictionary is large.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>In this article, we learned three ways by which a key-value pair can be removed from a dictionary - <code>pop()</code>, <code>del</code>, and dict comprehensions. Choosing the right method for the right size of dictionary can help in decreasing the runtime of the script and the memory usage.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Python: How to Add Key to a Dictionary]]></title><description><![CDATA[Let's add new keys to a Python dictionary.

In this tutorial, we'll take a look at <em>how to add keys to a dictionary in Python</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"addkeytoapythondictionary\">Add Key to a Python Dictionary</h3>\n<p>There are multiple ways to add a new key-value pair to an existing dictionary. Let's have a look at few common ways to do so.</p>\n<h4 id=\"addkeywithvalue\">Add Key with Value</h4>\n<p>We can add a new key to a dictionary by assigning a value to it. If the key is already present, it overwrites the value it points to. The key has to be written in subscript notation to the dictionary like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">my_dictionary[new_key] = new_value\n</code></pre>\n<p>This key-value pair will be added to the dictionary. If you're using Python 3.6 or later, it will be added as the last item of the dictionary.</p>\n<p>Let's make a dictionary, and then add a new key-value pair with this approach:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">squares = {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9}\nsquares[4] = 16 # Adding new key-value pair\nprint(squares)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will result in:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16}\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"addkeytodictionarywithoutvalue\">Add Key to Dictionary Without Value</h4>\n<p>If you'd just like to add a key, without a value, you can simply put <code>None</code> instead of the value, with any of the methods covered in this artice:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">squares = {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9}\nsquares['x'] = None # Adding new key without value\nprint(squares)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This results in:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 'x': None}\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"addmultiplekeyvaluepairswithupdate\">Add Multiple Key-Value Pairs with <em>update()</em></h4>\n<p>In Python, we can add multiple key-value pairs to an existing dictionary. This is achieved by using the <code>update()</code> method. This method takes an argument of type <code>dict</code> or any iterable that has the length of two - like <code>((key1, value1),)</code>, and updates the dictionary with new key-value pairs.</p>\n<p>If the key is already present in the dictionary, it gets overwritten with the new value.</p>\n<p>The keys can also be passed as keyword arguments to this method with their corresponding values, like <code>dictionary.update(new_key=new_value)</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is arguably the most popular method of adding new keys and values to a dictionary.</p>\n<p>Let's use the <code>update()</code> method to add multiple key-value pairs to a dictionary:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">rainbow = {'red': 1}\n\n# Update by passing dictionary \nnew_key_values_dict = {'orange': 2, 'yellow': 3}\nrainbow.update(new_key_values_dict)\nprint(&quot;update by passing dictionary&quot;)\nprint(rainbow)\n\n# Update by passing iterables\nnew_key_values_itr = (('green',4), ('blue',5))\nrainbow.update(new_key_values_itr)\nprint(&quot;update by passing iterables&quot;)\nprint(rainbow)\n\n# Update using keyword arguments\nrainbow.update(indigo=6, violet=7)\nprint(&quot;update using keyword arguments&quot;)\nprint(rainbow)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Running this code will produce the following output:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">update by passing dictionary\n{'red': 1, 'orange': 2, 'yellow': 3}\nupdate by passing iterables\n{'red': 1, 'orange': 2, 'yellow': 3, 'green': 4, 'blue': 5}\nupdate using keyword arguments\n{'red': 1, 'orange': 2, 'yellow': 3, 'green': 4, 'blue': 5, 'indigo': 6, 'violet': 7}\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"usingmergeoperatorpython39\">Using Merge Operator (Python 3.9+)</h4>\n<p>From Python version 3.9, Merge (<code>|</code>) and Update (<code>|=</code>) operators have been added to the built-in <code>dict</code> class.</p>\n<p>These are very convenient methods to add multiple key-value pairs to a dictionary. The Merge (<code>|</code>) operator creates a new dictionary with the keys and values of both of the given dictionaries. We can then assign this result to a new dictionary.</p>\n<p>Whereas the Update(<code>|=</code>) operator, adds the key-value pairs of the second dictionary into the first dictionary. So, the existing dictionary gets updated with multiple key-value pairs from another dictionary.</p>\n<p>Here's an example of using Merge(<code>|</code>) and Update(<code>|=</code>) operators to add new keys to a dictionary:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">colors_set1 = {‘red’: 1, 'orange’: 2, 'yellow': 3}\ncolors_set2 = {'green': 4, 'blue': 5, 'indigo': 6, 'violet': 7}\n\n# Merge operator\nrainbow = colors_set1 | colors_set2\nprint(&quot;using merge:&quot;, rainbow)\n\n# Update operator\ncolors_set1 |= colors_set2\nprint(&quot;using update:&quot;, colors_set1)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This code will produce the following output on the <strong>Python(3.9+)</strong> interpreter:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">using merge: {'red': 1, 'orange': 2, 'yellow': 3, 'green': 4, 'blue': 5, 'indigo': 6, 'violet': 7}\nusing update: {'red': 1, 'orange': 2, 'yellow': 3, 'green': 4, 'blue': 5, 'indigo': 6, 'violet': 7}\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>In this tutorial, we learned how we can add a new key to a dictionary. We first added the key-value pair using subscript notation - we added a key to a dictionary by assigning a value to it. We then looked at the <code>update()</code> method to add multiple key-value pairs to a dictionary. We've also used the <code>update()</code> method with parameters of type dictionary, tuple, and keyword arguments. Lastly, we probed into the Merge and Update operators available from Python versions 3.9 onwards.</p>\n<p>The <code>update()</code> method of dictionary proves to be the most popular way to add new keys to an existing dictionary.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spring Boot Thymeleaf Form Data Validation with Bean Validator]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this tutorial, we'll cover how to perform Spring Boot Thymeleaf Form Data Validation using the well-known Bean Validator library.]]></description><link>https://stackabuse.com/spring-boot-thymeleaf-form-data-validation-with-bean-validator/</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">600d85742c5e1a08f1ec774b</guid><category><![CDATA[java]]></category><category><![CDATA[spring]]></category><category><![CDATA[spring boot]]></category><category><![CDATA[thymeleaf]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alex Chirea]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2021 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h3 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h3>\n<p><em>Form Data Validation</em> is a very common, and rudimentary step in building any web application with user input. We want to make sure that certain ranges are respected, and that certain formats are followed. For example, we'll want to make sure that the user isn't <code>-345</code> years old, or that their email address is valid.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to validate form data - and the method you use depends on your application. In general, you'll want to perform <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://stackabuse.com/spring-boot-thymeleaf-form-data-validation-with-bean-validator/client-side-form-validation-using-vanilla-javascript\"><em>client-side validation</em></a>, as well as <em>server-side validation</em>. Client-side validation makes sure that unfiltered data doesn't even reach the back-end, while server-side validation makes sure that the wrong data isn't processed further.</p>\n<p>In this article, we'll cover <em>how to perform form data validation in Spring Boot with Thymeleaf</em>, as the template engine.</p>\n<p>We'll leverage Spring Boot's built-in <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://beanvalidation.org/\"><em>Bean Validation API</em></a>, which makes this process simple and straightforward.</p>\n<h3 id=\"springbootvalidationmavendependency\">Spring Boot Validation Maven Dependency</h3>\n<p>Spring Boot allows us to define validation criteria using annotations. In your Domain Model, you can simply annotate fields with the constraints, and it'll enforce them.</p>\n<p>For the validation annotations to work we need to add the following dependency:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-xml\">&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-validation&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"domainmodel\">Domain Model</h3>\n<p>Let's define a simple POJO, with a few fields that we want to validate:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">@Entity\npublic class Person {\n\n  @Id\n  @GeneratedValue(strategy= GenerationType.AUTO)\n  private Long id;\n\n  @NotEmpty\n  @Size(min = 5)\n  private String fullName;\n\n  @NotEmpty\n  @Email\n  private String email;\n\n  @NotNull\n  @Min(value = 18)\n  private Integer age;\n\n  // Getters and Setters\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, let's break the annotations we used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>@NotEmpty</code> - is used to constrain a field of type <code>String</code>, <code>Collection</code>, <code>Map</code>, or <code>Array</code> to not be <code>null</code> or empty.</li>\n<li><code>@Size([min = x, max = y])</code> - is used to define the rules for the size of a <code>String</code>, <code>Collection</code>, <code>Map</code>, or <code>Array</code>.</li>\n<li><code>@Email</code> - helps us to validate the string against a regex which defines the structure of a valid email.</li>\n<li><code>@NotNull</code> - tells Spring the field should not be null, but it <em>can be empty</em>.</li>\n<li><code>@Min</code> and <code>@Max</code> are used to specify the limits of a variable. For example, the <code>@Min</code> age could be set to, say, 18.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"persistencelayerrepository\">Persistence Layer - Repository</h3>\n<p>To create a simple CRUD repository, all we have to do is extend the <code>JpaRepository</code> and supply our domain model and the ID's data type:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">@Repository\npublic interface PersonRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;Person, Long&gt; {\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"creatingaformwiththymeleaf\">Creating a Form with Thymeleaf</h3>\n<p>Now, let's make a simple form using HTML and Bootstrap to collect information:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;form th:action=&quot;@{/add}&quot; th:object=&quot;${person}&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; class=&quot;form&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;label for=&quot;fullName&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt;\n        &lt;input class=&quot;form-control&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; th:field=&quot;*{fullName}&quot; id=&quot;fullName&quot; placeholder=&quot;Full Name&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;alert alert-warning&quot; th:if=&quot;${#fields.hasErrors('fullName')}&quot; th:errors=&quot;*{fullName}&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;label for=&quot;email&quot;&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;\n        &lt;input class=&quot;form-control&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; th:field=&quot;*{email}&quot; id=&quot;email&quot; placeholder=&quot;Email&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;alert alert-warning&quot; th:if=&quot;${#fields.hasErrors('email')}&quot; th:errors=&quot;*{email}&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;label for=&quot;age&quot;&gt;Age&lt;/label&gt;\n        &lt;input class=&quot;form-control&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; th:field=&quot;*{age}&quot; id=&quot;age&quot; placeholder=&quot;Age&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;alert alert-warning&quot; th:if=&quot;${#fields.hasErrors('age')}&quot; th:errors=&quot;*{age}&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot;  class=&quot;btn btn-success&quot; value=&quot;Add User&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The form points to <code>/add</code> and sends a <code>POST</code> request. The fields in our object, <code>fullName</code>, <code>age</code> and <code>email</code> are in the form, signified by <code>th:field</code>. Since we've got our <code>th:object=${person}</code>,we can refer to this <code>person</code> object by substituting it with a <code>*</code> before the fields.</p>\n<p><code>*{fullName}</code> is the same as <code>${person.fullName}</code>. Each input also has a hidden <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> which is shown only if the <code>${#fields.hasErrors()}</code> calls evaluate to <code>true</code>. If there aren't errors, this div doesn't exist. If there are, the <code>th:errors</code> tag lets us specify a message. If we simply pass in the field that causes the error, such as <code>th:errors=&quot;*{age}&quot;</code>, the default message from the Bean Validator API are used, for that field.</p>\n<p>This results in a form that looks like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://stackabuse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/spring-boot-thymeleaf-form-data-validation-with-bean-validator-1.png\" alt=\"basic html form\"></p>\n<p>Since these messages aren't very user-friendly, we'll want to customize them by supplying our own messages.</p>\n<h3 id=\"controller\">Controller</h3>\n<p>Now, let's make a controller that'll handle a request to save a <code>Person</code> into the database. As usual, we'll have a <code>@GetMapping()</code> to show the form, and a <code>@PostMapping</code> to handle the request. In the method signature of the <code>@PostMapping</code>, we'll annotate the POJO with <code>@Valid</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>@Valid</code> annotation triggers the <em>Bean Validator</em> to check if the fields populated in the object conform to the annotations we've used in the class definition. If you don't use the <code>@Valid</code> annotation, it won't check anything, and even values you might not expect can be populated in the object.</p>\n<p>In our case, the <code>Person person</code> object is the object that's populated with the inputs of a form:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">@GetMapping(&quot;/add&quot;)\npublic String showAddPersonForm(Person person) {\n  return &quot;add-person&quot;;\n}\n\n@PostMapping(&quot;/add&quot;)\npublic String addPerson(@Valid Person person, BindingResult result, Model model) {\n  if (result.hasErrors()) {\n    return &quot;add-person&quot;;\n  }\n  repository.save(person);\n  return &quot;redirect:/index&quot;;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If there are any issues with this <code>Person</code>, the <code>${fields}</code> attribute will have errors within it, tied to the field that caused the error.</p>\n<h3 id=\"customizingerrormessages\">Customizing Error Messages</h3>\n<p>To set a custom message for any validation constraint, you can use the <code>message</code> option:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">@NotEmpty(message = &quot;Field can't be empty!)\nprivate String field;\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can simply write these messages out in your model, like this. Though, it's considered good practice to put the validation messages in a <code>properties</code> file, that you can reference. This is done since you can bundle all validation messages together, and can update them if the models get changed at a later date.</p>\n<p>Let's make our <code>ValidationMessages.properties</code> under <code>src/main/resources</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-properties\">Size.Person.FullName=The Full Name should have at least 5 characters\n</code></pre>\n<p>We will then modify the <code>Person</code> model, and supply this property as the <code>message</code> of the <code>@Size</code> annotation:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">@NotEmpty(message = &quot;The Full Name can't be null&quot;)\n@Size(min = 5, message = &quot;{Size.Person.FullName}&quot;)\nprivate String fullName;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let's go back to our form and see how it looks now:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://stackabuse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/spring-boot-thymeleaf-form-data-validation-with-bean-validator-2.png\" alt=\"customized error messages spring boot bean validator\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>In this article, we've gone over how to use the Bean Validator API that Spring Boot uses to effortlessly perform form data validation with Thymeleaf.</p>\n<p>We've created a domain model, annotated our fields with Bean Validator constraints. Then, we've made a repository and controller to display the form and process it, as well as save the relevant information into a <code>Person</code> object, making sure that the fields are validated with the <code>@Valid</code> annotation.</p>\n<p>You can find the source code <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/alexchirea/SimpleSpringBootApp/tree/SpringValidationFormThymeleaf\">on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Print an Array in Java]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this tutorial, we'll print arrays in Java using the toString() and deepToString() methods, streams, for loops and iterators, with examples and explanations!]]></description><link>https://stackabuse.com/how-to-print-an-array-in-java/</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">6008dcc62c5e1a08f1ec758d</guid><category><![CDATA[java]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Mohamed Echout]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 09 Feb 2021 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h3 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h3>\n<p>Printing an array is a quick way to give us visibility on the values of the contents inside. Sometimes the array values are the desired output of the program.</p>\n<p>In this article, we'll take a look at <em>how to print an array in Java</em> using four different ways.</p>\n<p>While the &quot;best way&quot; depends on what your program needs to do, we begin with the simplest method for printing and then show more verbose ways to do it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#printanarrayusingarraystostringandarraysdeeptostring\">Print an Array Using Arrays.toString() and Arrays.deepToString()</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#printanarrayusingjava8streams\">Print an Array Using Java 8 Streams</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#printanarraybyconvertingtolist\">Print an Array by Converting to List</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#printanarrayusingforloops\">Print an Array Using For Loops</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#convertingtolistandusinganiterator\">Converting To List and Using an Iterator</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"printanarrayusingarraystostringandarraysdeeptostring\">Print an Array Using <em>Arrays.toString()</em> and <em>Arrays.deepToString()</em></h3>\n<p>The built-in <code>toString()</code> method is an extremely simple way to print out formatted versions of objects in Java.</p>\n<p>Every data type in Java is considered a class and by default, every class inherits from <code>java.lang.Object</code>, the root of Java's class hierarchy. That's why every class has a <code>toString()</code> method. However, arrays <em>don't</em> override the <code>toString()</code> method to format the output nicely, and it just returns the inherited value, which is the hash of the object.</p>\n<p>We print arrays using the <code>toString()</code> method from the class in <code>java.util.Arrays</code>.</p>\n<p>Take this example where we print the values of an array of integers:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">int[] intSequence = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};\n\nSystem.out.println(Arrays.toString(intSequence));\n</code></pre>\n<p>The code above will output the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note how all the elements are comma-separated and in square brackets. This method is like a visual representation of the array.</p>\n<p>We can use this method to print arrays of different types as well:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">double[] doubleValues = {5.5, 2.37, 9.9, 1.02};\nSystem.out.println(Arrays.toString(doubleValues));\n        \nString[] stringValues = {&quot;alabama&quot;, &quot;arkansas&quot;, &quot;kentucky&quot;};\nSystem.out.println(Arrays.toString(stringValues));\n</code></pre>\n<p>These respectively result in:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">[5.5, 2.37, 9.9, 1.02]\n[alabama, arkansas, kentucky]\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>toString()</code> method is only effective for one-dimensional arrays. When we have nested arrays we need use the <code>deepToString()</code> method:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">double[][] coordinates = {{40.50, 50.75}, {22.25, 32.75}};\nSystem.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(coordinates));\n        \nString[][] songLines = {{&quot;Take your nose off my keyboard&quot;}, {&quot;What you bothering me for?&quot;}};\nSystem.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(songLines));\n</code></pre>\n<p>These result in:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">[[40.5, 50.75], [22.25, 32.75]]\n[[Take your nose off my keyboard], [What you bothering me for?]]\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you need a visual of what's in your array at a glance, the <code>toString()</code> and <code>deepToString()</code> methods are your best option.</p>\n<p>However, these methods don't allow you to format your output. This approach is basically just a workaround for the fact that arrays don't override the <code>toString()</code> method by default.</p>\n<p>If you'd prefer some flexibility with the formatting, you might consider using <em>Java 8 Streams</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"printanarrayusingjava8streams\">Print an Array Using Java 8 Streams</h3>\n<p>One option for printing an array is to convert it to a stream of objects, then print each element in the stream. We have a few options to leverage streams to print our array.</p>\n<p>For example, we can print our array line by line like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">String[] languages = {&quot;Java&quot;, &quot;Python&quot;, &quot;JavaScript&quot;};\nArrays.stream(languages).forEach(System.out::println);\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case, we use the static <code>stream()</code> method of the <code>Arrays</code> class to create a sequential stream of our data. For each element in our stream, we call the <code>println()</code> function on it, making it appear line by line like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">Java\nPython\nJavaScript\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> We reference the <code>println()</code> function like this: <code>System.out::println</code>.  The <code>::</code> in Java is a method reference operator. The <code>forEach()</code> function can either use a <a href=\"https://stackabuse.com/lambda-expressions-in-java/\" target=\"_blank\">lambda function</a> or a <a href=\"https://stackabuse.com/method-references-in-java-8/\" target=\"_blank\">method reference</a>.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, we can use the <code>Stream</code> class from <code>java.util.stream.Stream</code> to similarly call the <code>println()</code> function on a stream of our array data. We can construct a Stream of this data using <code>Stream.of()</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">String[] languages = {&quot;Java&quot;, &quot;Python&quot;, &quot;JavaScript&quot;};\nStream.of(languages).forEach(System.out::println);\n</code></pre>\n<p>With this code we'll get the same output:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">Java\nPython\nJavaScript\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let's try this out with nested arrays as well, adding the release dates of the initial versions of these languages:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">String[][] languages = {{&quot;Java&quot;, &quot;1996&quot;}, {&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;1994&quot;}, {&quot;JavaScript&quot;, &quot;1995&quot;}};\n\nArrays.stream(languages).forEach(System.out::println);\n// OR\nStream.of(languages).forEach(System.out::println);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The output for each print via streams would look something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">[Ljava.lang.String;@e9e54c2\n[Ljava.lang.String;@65ab7765\n[Ljava.lang.String;@1b28cdfa\n</code></pre>\n<p>That doesn't work very well... We're calling <code>println()</code> on array objects again. We'll have to stream those objects again, and print their elements.</p>\n<p>To print nested arrays, we can use a lambda expression in the <code>forEach()</code> function that can go to the second level, by making another stream of each level, and printing the entries out that way:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">String[][] languages = {{&quot;Java&quot;, &quot;1996&quot;}, {&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;1994&quot;}, {&quot;JavaScript&quot;, &quot;1995&quot;}};\n        \nArrays.stream(languages).forEach(s -&gt; Arrays.stream(s).forEach(System.out::println)); \n// OR\nStream.of(languages).forEach(s -&gt; Arrays.stream(s).forEach(System.out::println));\n</code></pre>\n<p>This lambda function prints the elements in each nested array. When compiled and executed, we would get this output:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">Java\n1996\nPython\n1994\nJavaScript\n1995\n</code></pre>\n<p>Streams make working with collections a breeze. But Java is flexible to provide even more ways. The traditional for-loop does a lot for us still. Let's have a look at printing an array with loops.</p>\n<h3 id=\"printanarraybyconvertingtolist\">Print an Array by Converting to List</h3>\n<p>You can easily convert a Java array into a <code>List</code> implementation. There are various ways to do that, and we've covered each in detail in our <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://stackabuse.com/how-to-convert-a-java-array-to-arraylist\">How to Convert a Java Array to ArrayList</a> article.</p>\n<p>In short, calling <code>toString()</code>, or just printing out (which implicitly calls <code>toString()</code>) on a <code>List</code> implementation, will print out the contents:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">Integer[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};\nList&lt;Integer&gt; numberList = Arrays.asList(numbers);\n\nSystem.out.println(numberList);\n</code></pre>\n<p>This results in:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Additionally, you can use <code>.forEach()</code> natively on any <code>Collection</code>, which a <code>List</code> is. So, you can just go ahead and do this as well:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">Integer[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};\nArrays.asList(numbers).forEach(System.out::println);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Though, this isn't a nicely formatted option:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">12345678910\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can ditch the method reference and just use a lambda for more control:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">Integer[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};\nArrays.asList(numbers)\n        .forEach(number -&gt; System.out.print(String.format(&quot;%d, &quot;, number)));\n</code></pre>\n<p>This results in:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, \n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"printanarrayusingforloops\">Print an Array Using For Loops</h3>\n<p>A more well-known approach to printing an array in Java is to use a <code>for</code> loop. With a <code>for</code> loop we get the index of the element, and we can use the index to get the element of an array.</p>\n<p>We set up a <code>for</code> loop with a variable, commonly named <code>i</code>, as the counter starting from element <code>0</code>. This is then followed by the condition that compares <code>i</code> to the number of elements in the array.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: The number of elements in the array that will be used in the loop's condition should never be hardcoded. Java provides an attribute called <code>length</code> that allows the programmer to dynamically calculate the number of elements in an array.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, our <code>for</code> loop takes the incremental value in our case we will use the <code>i++</code> notation to keep increasing our counter by one element in each iteration.</p>\n<p>Once our loop is all set and ready, we will simply use the <code>System.out.println()</code> statement to display each element in the array using the rectangular bracket notation <code>[i]</code> taking as input our counter <code>i</code>.</p>\n<p>Here's an example where we print all the elements of an integer array line by line:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};\n\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; numbers.length; i++){\n    System.out.println(numbers[i]);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Executing this code would print the following in your console:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n</code></pre>\n<p>There isn't much more to using <code>for</code> loops. They're quite flexible and conceptually simple. For example, if you had nested arrays then you'll use nested <code>for</code> loops.</p>\n<p>Finally, let's have a look at iterators and lists.</p>\n<h3 id=\"convertingtolistandusinganiterator\">Converting To List and Using an Iterator</h3>\n<p>A Java iterator object allows us to display each element of our array without having to use the index approach we covered in the <code>for</code> loop section.</p>\n<p>To use iterators, we have to change the datatype of the array to a <code>List</code>. We can do this by using the <code>Array.asList()</code> method and save the list values returned in a new variable. The <code>asList()</code> method takes in the array, and turns it into a <code>List</code> implementation.</p>\n<p>Next, you will need an iterator object to set up your array iterator. An iterator is like a pointer that points to every element in the array. The iterator helps you to inspect each element in a singular manner.</p>\n<p>To create an iterator object, we will use the <code>iterator()</code> method of our <code>List</code>. Once our iterator object was created we use the <code>while</code> loop as it offers a  more compact way of printing each element return by the iterator.</p>\n<p>The <code>while</code> loop's condition will contain a call to the  <code>hasNext()</code> method of our iterator. Inside the <code>while</code> loop, we print each element by calling <code>System.out.println()</code>. We get elements from the iterator by calling the <code>next()</code> method. The <code>while</code> loop will keep iterating over each element until we have traversed our array (via the <code>List</code>).</p>\n<p>Here's an example where we take an array of integers and print each element line by line by using an iterator:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">Integer[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};\nList&lt;Integer&gt; numberList = Arrays.asList(numbers);\nIterator&lt;Integer&gt; numberIterator = numberList.iterator();\n\nwhile(numberIterator.hasNext()) {\n    System.out.println(numberIterator.next());\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Compared to the for loops, this method is preferred by developers who rather not deal with array indices. You are guaranteed the upcoming element with <code>next()</code>. Iterators are powerful because we use this same flow for any type of <code>List</code> like an <code>ArrayList</code> or a <code>LinkedList</code>, as well as other collections like a <code>Map</code> or a <code>Set</code>!</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>In this article, we covered the main methods used to print an array in Java. We started by using the built-in Java methods <code>toString()</code> and <code>deepToString()</code>.</p>\n<p>From there, we used streams so that we can quickly print array elements line by line. We've also covered how to convert an array to a list, which you can either just call or use the Java 8 Stream API for more granular control.</p>\n<p>Then, we used the traditional <code>for</code> loop structure to print every element individually.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, we used the iterator object to print every element separately using the <code>next()</code> method inside a <code>while</code> loop. The approaches covered in the chapter can be used depending on the use case and the problem you are trying to solve.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Compare Two Dates in JavaScript]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this tutorial, we'll go over how to compare dates in vanilla JavaScript, using the built-in methods and operators, with examples.]]></description><link>https://stackabuse.com/compare-two-dates-in-javascript/</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">6009dbf62c5e1a08f1ec759f</guid><category><![CDATA[javascript]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Abhilash Kakumanu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 08 Feb 2021 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h3 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h3>\n<p>Dates are a really common data type developers work with. From timestamps of certain actions, to reports, sign up features and limited-time access in systems that require subscriptions - we oftentimes have to compare dates.</p>\n<p>That is, we compare if a date is after or before another, if the date is <em>today</em>, how many days there are between dates, etc.</p>\n<p>In this article, we'll take a look at <em>how to compare two dates in JavaScript</em>, helping us deduce whether a date is before or after another.</p>\n<h3 id=\"thedateobjectinjavascript\">The <em>Date</em> Object in JavaScript</h3>\n<p>Web developers commonly use external packages (like <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment\">Moment.js</a>) to handle date-time operations. But, as the modern web evolved, JavaScript introduced a new object constructor called <code>Date</code> to handle date-time operations.</p>\n<p>This means that you don't need an external library to perform rudimentary checks and operations, which makes it easier to perform these things in Vanilla JS.</p>\n<p>The <code>Date</code> class is really simple to understand under the hood - it just stores <em>Unix time</em> measured in milliseconds.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Unix time</em> is measured as the number of seconds elapsed since the Unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC 1 January 1970), which is a completely arbitrary date.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even though this implementation seems a bit simplistic, the addition of the <code>Date</code> class was quite a big improvement, since there was finally a level of abstraction between developers and raw dates.</p>\n<p>Now, let's look at different ways to compare two dates using <code>Date</code> objects.</p>\n<h3 id=\"comparingtwodatesinjavascript\">Comparing Two Dates in JavaScript</h3>\n<p>We can use comparison operators like <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> two compare two <code>Date</code> objects, and under the hood, their time counters are effectively compared. You're effectively comparing two integer counters:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function dateCompare(d1, d2){\n    const date1 = new Date(d1);\n    const date2 = new Date(d2);\n\n    if(date1 &gt; date2){\n        console.log(`${d1} is greater than ${d2}`)\n    } else if(date1 &lt; date2){\n        console.log(`${d2} is greater than ${d1}`)\n    } else{\n        console.log(`Both dates are equal`)\n    }\n}\n\ndateCompare(&quot;6/11/2020&quot;, &quot;7/8/2019&quot;)\ndateCompare(&quot;01/01/2021&quot;, &quot;01/01/2021&quot;)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This results in:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-console\">6/11/2020 is greater than 7/8/2019\nBoth dates are equal\n</code></pre>\n<p>As we can see, comparing dates just boils down to converting the provided strings into <code>Date</code> objects and comparing them with an appropriate comparison operator.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://stackabuse.com/javascript-loose-equality-operator-vs-strict-equality-operator/\">Equality operators</a> (<code>==</code> and <code>===</code>) don't work with <code>Date</code> objects, so we don't explicitly check if they're the same.</p>\n<p>Another way to compare two dates is by using the built-in <code>getTime()</code> method.</p>\n<p>The <code>getTime()</code> method returns the number of milliseconds elapsed since the Unix epoch. Additionally, you can use the, <code>getDate()</code>, <code>getHours()</code>, <code>getDay()</code>, <code>getMonth()</code> and <code>getYear()</code> methods to further specify and compare information, amongst other similarly named methods.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can also use the <code>getUTCDay()</code>, <code>getUTCDate()</code>, <code>getUTCHour()</code>, <code>getUTCMinute()</code>, etc. methods, which return the given temporal identifiers, zoned specifically to UTC.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> With this approach, you <em>can</em> use equality operators!</p>\n<p>Let's take a look at an example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function compareDates(d1, d2){\n    const date1 = new Date(d1);\n    const date2 = new Date(d2);\n\n    if(date1.getTime() &gt; date2.getTime()){\n        console.log(`${d1} is greater than ${d2} in terms of milliseconds`)\n    } else if(date1.getYear() &lt; date2.getYear()){\n        console.log(`${d2} is greater than ${d1} in terms of years`)\n    } else if(date1.getDate() === date2.getDate()){\n        console.log(`Both dates are equal`)\n    }\n}\n\ncompareDates(&quot;9/10/1997&quot;, &quot;9/10/2000&quot;)\ncompareDates(&quot;11/11/2021&quot;, &quot;11/1/2021&quot;)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This results in:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-console\">9/10/2000 is greater than 09/10/1997 in terms of years\n11/11/2021 is greater than 11/1/2021 in terms of milliseconds\n</code></pre>\n<p>Though, since we're working with <code>if</code> and <code>if-else</code> blocks, some statements never get to execute. For example, <code>9/10/1997</code> and <code>9/10/2000</code> have the same <em>date</em>, the <code>9/10</code>, though, not the same year.</p>\n<p>For example, this code:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function compareDates(d1, d2){\n    const date1 = new Date(d1);\n    const date2 = new Date(d2);\n    \n    if(date1.getDate() === date2.getDate()){\n        console.log(`Both dates are equal`)\n    }\n}\n\ncompareDates(&quot;09/10/1997&quot;, &quot;9/10/2000&quot;)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Would result in:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-console\">Both dates are equal\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since we're just comparing the date, without the year in mind.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>In this article, we've briefly gone over how JavaScript handles dates using <code>Date</code> objects.

Covariance and Correlation measures aid in establishing this.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Covariance brings about the <em>variation</em> across variables. We use covariance to measure how much two variables change with each other. Correlation reveals the <em>relation</em> between the variables. We use correlation to determine how strongly linked two variables are to each other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this article, we'll learn how to calculate the covariance and correlation in Python.</p>\n<h3 id=\"covarianceandcorrelationinsimpleterms\">Covariance and Correlation - In Simple Terms</h3>\n<p>Both covariance and correlation are about the relationship between the variables. Covariance defines the <em>directional association</em> between the variables. Covariance values range from <em>-inf</em> to <em>+inf</em> where a positive value denotes that both the variables move in the same direction and a negative value denotes that both the variables move in opposite directions.</p>\n<p>Correlation is a standardized statistical measure that expresses the extent to which two variables are linearly related (meaning how much they change together at a constant rate). The <em>strength and directional association</em> of the relationship between two variables are defined by correlation and it ranges from -1 to +1. Similar to covariance, a positive value denotes that both variables move in the same direction whereas a negative value tells us that they move in opposite directions.</p>\n<p>Both covariance and correlation are vital tools used in data exploration for feature selection and multivariate analyses. For example, an investor looking to spread the risk of a portfolio might look for stocks with a high covariance, as it suggests that their prices move up at the same time. However, a similar movement is not enough on its own. The investor would then use the correlation metric to determine how strongly linked those stock prices are to each other.</p>\n<h3 id=\"setupforpythoncoderetrievingsampledata\">Setup for Python Code - Retrieving Sample Data</h3>\n<p>With the basics learned from the previous section, let's move ahead to calculate covariance in python. For this example, we will be working on the well-known <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Iris dataset</a>. We're only working with the <code>setosa</code> species to be specific, hence this will be just a sample of the dataset about some <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=setosa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">lovely purple flowers</a>!</p>\n<p>Let's have a look at the dataset, on which we will be performing the analysis:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://stackabuse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/covariance-and-correlation-in-python-1.png\" alt=\"Preview of the Iris dataset\"></p>\n<p>We are about to pick two columns, for our analysis - <code>sepal_length</code> and <code>sepal_width</code>.</p>\n<p>In a new Python file (you can name it <code>covariance_correlation.py</code>), let's begin by creating two lists with values for the <code>sepal_length</code> and <code>sepal_width</code> properties of the flower:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">with open('iris_setosa.csv','r') as f:\n    g=f.readlines()\n    # Each line is split based on commas, and the list of floats are formed \n    sep_length = [float(x.split(',')[0]) for x in g[1:]]\n    sep_width  = [float(x.split(',')[1]) for x in g[1:]]\n</code></pre>\n<p>In data science, it always helps to visualize the data you're working on. Here's a Seaborn regression plot (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://stackabuse.com/seaborn-scatter-plot-tutorial-and-examples/\">Scatter Plot</a> + linear regression fit) of these setosa properties on different axes:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://stackabuse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/covariance-and-correlation-in-python-2.png\" alt=\"Scatterplot of sepal_length and sepal_width\"></p>\n<p>Visually the data points seem to be having a high correlation close to the regression line. Let's see if our observations match up to their covariance and correlation values.</p>\n<h3 id=\"calculatingcovarianceinpython\">Calculating Covariance in Python</h3>\n<p>The following formula computes the covariance:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://stackabuse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/covariance-and-correlation-in-python-3.png\" alt=\"Formula to calculate Covariance\"></p>\n<p>In the above formula,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub> - are individual elements of the x and y series</li>\n<li>x̄, y̅ - are the mathematical means of the x and y series</li>\n<li>N - is the number of elements in the series</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The denominator is <code>N</code> for a whole dataset and <code>N - 1</code> in the case of a sample. As our dataset is a small sample of the entire Iris dataset, we use <code>N - 1</code>.</p>\n<p>With the math formula mentioned above as our reference, let's create this function in pure Python:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">def covariance(x, y):\n    # Finding the mean of the series x and y\n    mean_x = sum(x)/float(len(x))\n    mean_y = sum(y)/float(len(y))\n    # Subtracting mean from the individual elements\n    sub_x = [i - mean_x for i in x]\n    sub_y = [i - mean_y for i in y]\n    numerator = sum([sub_x[i]*sub_y[i] for i in range(len(sub_x))])\n    denominator = len(x)-1\n    cov = numerator/denominator\n    return cov\n\nwith open('iris_setosa.csv', 'r') as f:\n    ...\n    cov_func = covariance(sep_length, sep_width)\n    print(&quot;Covariance from the custom function:&quot;, cov_func)\n</code></pre>\n<p>We first find the mean values of our datasets. We then use a list comprehension to iterate over every element in our two series' of data and subtract their values from the mean. A for loop could have been used a well if that's your preference.</p>\n<p>We then use those intermediate values of the two series' and multiply them with each other in another list comprehension. We sum the result of that list and store it as the <code>numerator</code>. The <code>denominator</code> is a lot easier to calculate, be sure to decraese it by 1 when you're finding the covariance for sample data!</p>\n<p>We then return the value when the <code>numerator</code> is divided by its <code>denominator</code>, which results in the covariance.</p>\n<p>Running our script would give us this output:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">Covariance from the custom function: 0.09921632653061219\n</code></pre>\n<p>The positive value denotes that both the variables move in the same direction.</p>\n<h3 id=\"calculatingcorrelationinpython\">Calculating Correlation in Python</h3>\n<p>The most widely used formula to compute correlation coefficient is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://stackabuse.com/calculating-pearson-correlation-coefficient-in-python-with-numpy/\">Pearson's</a> 'r':</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://stackabuse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/covariance-and-correlation-in-python-4.png\" alt=\"Formula to calculate Correlation\"></p>\n<p>In the above formula,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub> - are individual elements of the x and y series</li>\n<li>The numerator corresponds to the covariance</li>\n<li>The denominators correspond to the individual standard deviations of x and y</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Seems like we've discussed everything we need to get the correlation in this <a href=\"https://stackabuse.com/calculating-mean-median-and-mode-in-python/\" target=\"_blank\">series of articles</a>!</p>\n<p>Let's calculate the correlation now:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">def correlation(x, y):\n    # Finding the mean of the series x and y\n    mean_x = sum(x)/float(len(x))\n    mean_y = sum(y)/float(len(y))\n    # Subtracting mean from the individual elements\n    sub_x = [i-mean_x for i in x]\n    sub_y = [i-mean_y for i in y]\n    # covariance for x and y\n    numerator = sum([sub_x[i]*sub_y[i] for i in range(len(sub_x))])\n    # Standard Deviation of x and y\n    std_deviation_x = sum([sub_x[i]**2.0 for i in range(len(sub_x))])\n    std_deviation_y = sum([sub_y[i]**2.0 for i in range(len(sub_y))])\n    # squaring by 0.5 to find the square root\n    denominator = (std_deviation_x*std_deviation_y)**0.5 # short but equivalent to (std_deviation_x**0.5) * (std_deviation_y**0.5)\n    cor = numerator/denominator\n    return cor\n\nwith open('iris_setosa.csv', 'r') as f:\n    ...\n    cor_func = correlation(sep_length, sep_width)\n    print(&quot;Correlation from the custom function:&quot;, cor_func)\n</code></pre>\n<p>As this value needs the covariance of the two variables, our function pretty much works out that value once again.

To find the number of elements stored in a dictionary we can use the <code>len()</code> function.</p>\n<p>To find the size of a dictionary in bytes we can use the <code>getsizeof()</code> function of the <code>sys</code> module.</p>\n<p>To count the elements of a nested dictionary, we can use a recursive function.</p>\n<h3 id=\"findingthesizeofthedictionary\">Finding the Size of the Dictionary</h3>\n<p>The <code>len()</code> function is widely used to determine the size of objects in Python. In our case, passing a dictionary object to this function will return the size of the dictionary i.e. the number of key-value pairs present in the dictionary.</p>\n<p>Because these objects keep track of their length, this operation has an O(1) time complexity:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">my_dict = {1: &quot;a&quot;, 2: &quot;b&quot;}\nprint(&quot;The length of the dictionary is {}&quot;.format(len(my_dict)))\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above snippet returns this output:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">The length of the dictionary is 2\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"findingthesizeofthedictionaryinbytes\">Finding the Size of the Dictionary in Bytes</h3>\n<p>The memory size of the dictionary object in bytes can be determined by the <code>getsizeof()</code> function. This function is available from the <code>sys</code> module. Like <code>len()</code>, it can be used to find the size of any Python object.</p>\n<p>This is particularly useful when we need code that needs to be performant, and/or requires regular monitoring. Let's take our previous example, and get a dictionary's size in bytes instead of the number of elements:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">import sys\n\nmy_dict = {1: &quot;a&quot;, 2: &quot;b&quot;}\nprint(&quot;The size of the dictionary is {} bytes&quot;.format(sys.getsizeof(my_dict)))\n</code></pre>\n<p>The resulting output is:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">The size of the dictionary is 232 bytes\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"findingthesizeofnesteddictionaries\">Finding the Size of Nested Dictionaries</h3>\n<p>A nested dictionary is a dictionary inside a dictionary, or a dictionary with multiple levels of key-value pairs. These nested dictionaries help in simplifying complex structures like JSON responses from APIs.</p>\n<p>These look something along the lines of:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{&quot;dict1&quot;: {&quot;dict2&quot;: &quot;value 1&quot;}}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Using the <code>len()</code> to get the count of all key-value pairings will not work as it gives the size of the object for the first level of keys only. To find the number of all the nested keys, we can write a custom recursive function to count the keys. This function would take a dictionary and a counter as arguments and iterates through each key.</p>\n<p>For every iteration, the function checks if the instance of the key under consideration is a dictionary. If it's true, the function is recursively called again by appending the counter variable to <code>counter+1</code> and passing the dictionary under evaluation as arguments.</p>\n<p>This recursive function exits upon the complete iteration, returning the length of the dictionary as the variable: <code>counter</code>.</p>\n<p>If the key isn't a dictionary instance, the counter is simply appended to <code>counter+1</code>. The function returns the <code>counter</code> value as a result of the iteration which gives the size of the dictionary under evaluation.</p>\n<p>Hence, the count of the nested keys is evaluated using this function as shown below:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">def count_keys(dict_, counter=0):\n    for each_key in dict_:\n        if isinstance(dict_[each_key], dict):\n            # Recursive call\n            counter = count_keys(dict_[each_key], counter + 1)\n        else:\n            counter += 1\n    return counter\n\nmy_dict = {\n       'Name':\n           {\n               'first_name': 'Sherlock',\n               'Last_name': 'Holmes'\n           },\n       'Locality':\n           {\n           'Address':\n               {\n                   'Street': '221B Baker Street'\n               },\n           'City': 'London',\n           'Country': 'United Kingdom'\n           }\n      }\n\nprint('The length of the nested dictionary is {}'.format(count_keys(my_dict)))\n</code></pre>\n<p>And when the snippet gets executed, we get the following output corresponding to the number of keys present in the dictionary:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">The length of the nested dictionary is 8\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>In this article, we have explored the methods to calculate the size and length of dictionaries and nested dictionaries.</p>\n<p>These functions can be very helpful in serving JSON objects over APIs: there are limits imposed by webservers for the size of JSON objects served over APIs and these functions can be used to keep the length and size in check.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Form Data Validation in Node.js with express-validator]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this tutorial, we'll cover how to perform form data validation in Node.js with express-validator, a wrapper for the popular Validator.js library, with examples.]]></description><link>https://stackabuse.com/form-data-validation-in-nodejs-with-express-validator/</link><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">6004d39d2c5e1a08f1ec73ee</guid><category><![CDATA[javascript]]></category><category><![CDATA[node]]></category><category><![CDATA[express]]></category><category><![CDATA[validation]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Guest Contributor]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 03 Feb 2021 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h3 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h3>\n<p>It is imperative to carry out server-side validation when building applications - especially client-facing applications. The reason being, one can never rely on the user’s input alone; as these inputs sometimes contain bogus/malicious data.</p>\n<p>Client-side validation is a great way to sift through most of the input, but you still need to perform server-side validation as well.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to validate data in Node.js and in this article, we will be taking a look at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https://express-validator.github.io/docs/index.html\">express-validator</a>. Express-validator is a library which wraps around <code>validator.js</code> and exposes its functions as a set of middlewares.</p>\n<h3 id=\"projectsetup\">Project Setup</h3>\n<p>For this tutorial, we will be building a demo backend server to mock user registration and login with Node.js. These fields will enforce certain rules and we'll validate the data that comes through.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Please note we will not be handling actual user registration and login logic i.e saving user data and implementing authentication as this is outside the scope of this article.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To get started, we will create a project folder, navigate into it and initialize it:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\"># Create the project folder\n$ mkdir express-validator-tut\n\n# Navigate into the project folder\n$ cd express-validator-tut\n\n# Initialize project\n$ yarn init -y\n# OR\n$ npm init -y\n</code></pre>\n<p>When done, we will install the following dependencies by running the command below:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">$ yarn add body-parser express express-validator\n# OR\n$ npm i body-parser express express-validator\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let's take a look at what we've installed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>express:</strong> A lightweight web application framework for Node.js. We will be using this to handle routing in our backend server.</li>\n<li><strong>body-parser:</strong> A middleware which will help us parse incoming request inputs (user inputs) to the <code>req.body</code> object.</li>\n<li><strong>express-validator:</strong> The library which we will be using to handle incoming input validation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lastly, we will create an <code>index.js</code> file in our project directory to host the boilerplate code for the instantiation of an Express application/server:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// index.js\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\nconst port = 2022;\n\napp.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\n\napp.post('/register', (req, res) =&gt; {});\n    \napp.listen(port);\nconsole.log('See where it all happens at http://localhost:'+port);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, let's run this app with <code>node</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">$ node index.js \n</code></pre>\n<p>If all goes well, your terminal should output something along the lines of:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://stackabuse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/form-data-validation-in-nodejs-with-express-validator-1.png\" alt=\"expressjs boilerplate server prompt\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"standardvalidationruleswithexpressvalidator\">Standard Validation Rules with express-validator</h3>\n<p>In this section, we will learn how to add simple validation and sanitisation rules to incoming requests. Firstly, we want to check if the value input into the email field is a valid email or not. Then, we'll want to enforce that the password contains at least 6 characters.</p>\n<p>To get started, let's add a couple of middleware functions to our <code>/login</code> route:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// index.js\n...\nconst { body, validationResult } = require('express-validator');\n\napp.post('/login',\n    body('email').isEmail().normalizeEmail(),\n    body('password').isLength({\n        min: 6\n    }),\n    (req, res) =&gt; {\n        const errors = validationResult(req);\n\n        if (!errors.isEmpty()) {\n            return res.status(400).json({\n                success: false,\n                errors: errors.array()\n            });\n        }\n\n        res.status(200).json({\n            success: true,\n            message: 'Login successful',\n        })\n    });\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the snippet above, we are making use of two validator methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>isEmail()</code>: This validator function checks if the incoming string is a valid email address.</li>\n<li><code>isLength()</code>: This validator checks if the length of a string falls in a specified range. In our case, the range specified is a minimum of 6 characters.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of the other methods we could've used are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>isNumeric()</code> - Checks if the input is numeric</li>\n<li><code>contains()</code> - Checks if the input contains a certain value</li>\n<li><code>isBoolean()</code> - Check is the input is a boolean value</li>\n<li><code>isCurrency()</code> - Checks if the input is currency-formatted</li>\n<li><code>isJSON()</code> - Checks if the input is JSON</li>\n<li><code>isMobilePhone()</code> - Checks is the input is a valid mobile phone number</li>\n<li><code>isPostalCode()</code> - Checks if the input is a valid postal code</li>\n<li><code>isBefore()</code> and <code>isAfter()</code> - Checks if a date is before or after another date</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are others, but these are probably the ones to cover most of your validation needs.</p>\n<p>To ensure email addresses supplied by the user is free of noise and irregularities we will add a sanitiser to our email field as seen in the snippet above. The <code>normalizeEmail()</code> method helps to convert the emails entered into the standard approved format. This means if a user enters, for example, <code>username@googlemail.com</code>, it will be canonicalised to <code>username@gmail.com</code>.</p>\n<p>Validator.js offers some flexibility as this option can be toggled <code>off</code> or <code>on</code> but is set to <code>on</code> by default. There's a bunch of options for normalization you might want to check out if you're planning on normalizing the input. If you'd like to read more about other validators/sanitizer functions, you can check out Validator.js' <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js\">official documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>Let's test out our code by sending a request with an invalid password, and a <code>@googleemail.com</code> email, using Postman or <code>curl</code>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://stackabuse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/form-data-validation-in-nodejs-with-express-validator-2.png\" alt=\"simple data validation\"></p>\n<p>So far, we took a look at how we could validate incoming inputs for a sample login endpoint. Let's now switch to the registration endpoint and cover tasks like custom validation rules, error messages, schema validation and standardization of validation messages.</p>\n<h3 id=\"customvalidationrulesanderrormessageswithexpressvalidator\">Custom Validation Rules and Error Messages with express-validator</h3>\n<p>To get started, let’s create our user registration endpoint by adding the following snippet to our <code>index.js</code> file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// index.js\n...\napp.post('/register', (req, res) =&gt; {\n    // Validate incoming input\n    res.status(200).json({\n        success: true,\n        message: 'Registration successful',\n    });\n});\n...\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"custommethod\"><em>custom()</em> Method</h4>\n<p>To make sure our users input unique usernames during registration, we can't use the standard methods wrapped from Validator.js methods, since there is no method to check it.</p>\n<p>We'll have to write a custom validator for this, which can be done using the <code>custom()</code> method. The <code>custom()</code> method accepts a function, which can additionally be async. If the function is async, you'll want to reject the promise if the validation fails, and specify a custom message. If not, you can throw an exception.</p>\n<p>Let's start with rejecting a promise first:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// index.js\n...\napp.post('/register',\n    body(&quot;username&quot;).custom(value =&gt; {\n        return User.find({\n            username: value\n        }).then(user =&gt; {\n            if (user.length &gt; 0) {\n                // Custom error message and reject\n                // the promise\n                return Promise.reject('Username already in use');\n            }\n        });\n    }),\n    (req, res) =&gt; {\n        // Validate incoming input\n        const errors = validationResult(req);\n        if (!errors.isEmpty()) {\n            return res.status(400).json({\n                errors: errors.array()\n            });\n        }\n        ...\n    })\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the code snippet above, we are calling the <code>find()</code> method on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://stackabuse.com/mongoose-with-nodejs-object-data-modeling/\">User model Mongoose schema</a> to check if the username entered by the client already exists in our database.</p>\n<p>If it's present, we reject the promise with a message we'd like to return back to the user.</p>\n<p>Although MongoDB will automatically detect this if the username field was marked unique when specifying the database schema. It’s advisable to handle this before it gets to the DB so our application does not crash prematurely.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can throw an exception as a way to signify invalid input:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// index.js\n...\n    \napp.post('/register',\n        body(&quot;username&quot;).custom(value =&gt; {\n            return User.find({\n                username: value\n            }).then(user =&gt; {\n                if (user.length &gt; 0) {\n                    throw (&quot;Username is taken!&quot;); //custom error message\n                }\n            });\n        }),\n...\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"withmessagemethod\"><em>withMessage()</em> Method</h4>\n<p>The second way to implement custom validation error messages is by using the <code>withMessage()</code>chain. You can put a number of validators, followed by <code>withMessage()</code> chained methods to specify error messages for each validation:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">body(&quot;parameter&quot;)\n    .validator1()\n    .withMessage('Message 1')\n    .validator2()\n    .withMessage('Message 2')\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let's apply this with actual methods to our example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// index.js\n    \n...\napp.post('/register',\n    body(&quot;password&quot;).isStrongPassword({\n        minLength: 8,\n        minLowercase: 1,\n        minUppercase: 1,\n        minNumbers: 1\n    })\n    .withMessage(&quot;Password must be greater than 8 and contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number&quot;),\n    (req, res) =&gt; {\n        // Validate incoming input\n    })\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let's make another request, with an invalid password and a username that's already in use:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://stackabuse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/form-data-validation-in-nodejs-with-express-validator-3.png\" alt=\"custom validation rules and error messages\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"schemavalidationwithexpressvalidator\">Schema Validation with express-validator</h3>\n<p>Schema validation offers a cleaner approach to validating data. Instead of calling numerous functions, we specify  the validation rules for each field and pass the schema into a single middleware function called <code>checkSchema()</code>.</p>\n<p>In the snippet below, we will be creating a validation schema for user registration endpoint:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// index.js\n... \nconst {body, checkSchema, validationResult} = require('express-validator');\nconst registrationSchema = {\n    username: {\n        custom: {\n            options: value =&gt; {\n                return User.find({\n                    username: value\n                }).then(user =&gt; {\n                    if (user.length &gt; 0) {\n                        return Promise.reject('Username already in use')\n                    }\n                })\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    gender: {\n        notEmpty: true,\n        errorMessage: &quot;Gender field cannot be empty&quot;\n    },\n    password: {\n        isStrongPassword: {\n            minLength: 8,\n            minLowercase: 1,\n            minUppercase: 1,\n            minNumbers: 1\n        },\n        errorMessage: &quot;Password must be greater than 8 and contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number&quot;,\n    },\n    phone: {\n        notEmpty: true,\n        errorMessage: &quot;Phone number cannot be empty&quot;\n    },\n    email: {\n        normalizeEmail: true,\n        custom: {\n            options: value =&gt; {\n                return User.find({\n                    email: value\n                }).then(user =&gt; {\n                    if (user.length &gt; 0) {\n                        return Promise.reject('Email address already taken')\n                    }\n                })\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>By specifying a schema, we can drill into specific input fields to apply validators and sanitizers, and it's much more readable than chaining a lot of methods with validation messages like we've seen in the previous sections.</p>\n<p>Now, we can go ahead and use this <code>checkSchema()</code> to validate data on registration:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">app.post('/signup', checkSchema(registrationSchema), (req, res) =&gt; {\n    // Validate incoming input\n    const errors = validationResult(req);\n\n    if (!errors.isEmpty()) {\n        return res.status(400).json({\n            errors: errors.array()\n        });\n    }\n\n    res.status(200).json({\n        success: true,\n        message: 'Registration successful',\n    });\n})\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you only need a small amount of validations and want to keep it simple, you can use methods. If you have a huge amount of validations to be done, it'll be more readable if you use schema validation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"standardizingvalidationresponseswithexpressvalidator\">Standardizing Validation Responses with express-validator</h3>\n<p><code>express-validator</code> makes it possible to standardise validation error responses. This means you can create your middleware functions to run validations and handle validation errors.</p>\n<p>An example of how this can be done is by creating a <code>validate()</code> function which will accept all our validators and run them in parallel using <code>Promise.all()</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// index.js\nconst validate = validations =&gt; {\n    return async (req, res, next) =&gt; {\n        await Promise.all(validations.map(validation =&gt; validation.run(req)));\n\n        const errors = validationResult(req);\n        if (errors.isEmpty()) {\n            return next();\n        }\n\n        res.status(400).json({\n            errors: errors.array()\n        });\n    };\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now our validate function has been created we can re-use it on multiple routes. Let's apply it to our login and registration routes:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// index.js\n...\napp.post('/login', validate([\n        body('email').isEmail().normalizeEmail(),\n        body('password').isLength({\n            min: 12\n        })\n    ]),\n    (req, res) =&gt; {\n        // Process data\n        res.status(200).json({\n            success: true,\n            message: 'Login successful',\n        })\n    });\n\napp.post('/register', validate(checkSchema(registrationSchema)), (req, res) =&gt; {\n    // Process data\n    res.status(200).json({\n        success: true,\n        message: 'Registration successful',\n    });\n});\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>As seen in the snippet above - the use of a custom validation middleware which runs all our validators and sanitizers not only a gives us a performance boost with the <code>Promise.all()</code> call, but we also get to improve code readability. This will prove useful when we need to validate a lot of form fields.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>In this article, we've gone over the basic and more advanced usage of <code>express-validator</code>, a great lightweight library that wraps around the well-known <code>validator.js</code> library.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>"},"redirectURL":"","headersSize":-1,"bodySize":173983},"cache":{},"timings":{"blocked":-1,"dns":-1,"connect":-1,"ssl":-1,"send":3.1987999975681305,"wait":741.8411000072956,"receive":52.63409999012947}},{"pageref":"Embarcadero","startedDateTime":"2021-02-23T16:57:23.876-07:00","time":840.3923000097275,"request":{"method":"GET","url":"https://programesecure.com/feed/","httpVersion":"HTTP/1.1","cookies":[],"headers":[{"name":"connection","value":"Keep-Alive"},{"name":"cookie","value":"__cfruid=c380f2086cca5447b9e1d48d14751967180543aa-1614124635; uid=lo_1fc4bf97e9f9; __cfduid=d47d2779bf39e49c3c7af6c553cc1dede1614124629"},{"name":"user-agent","value":"Embarcadero URI Client/1.0"},{"name":"host","value":"programesecure.com"}],"queryString":[],"headersSize":-1,"bodySize":0},"response":{"status":200,"statusText":"OK","httpVersion":"HTTP/1.1","cookies":[],"headers":[{"name":"date","value":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 23:57:23 GMT"},{"name":"content-type","value":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8"},{"name":"transfer-encoding","value":"chunked"},{"name":"connection","value":"keep-alive"},{"name":"link","value":"<https://programesecure.com/wp-json/>; rel=\"https://api.w.org/\""},{"name":"last-modified","value":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 19:56:17 GMT"},{"name":"cache-control","value":"max-age=3600"},{"name":"expires","value":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 00:57:22 GMT"},{"name":"vary","value":"Accept-Encoding"},{"name":"referrer-policy","value":"no-referrer-when-downgrade"},{"name":"cf-cache-status","value":"DYNAMIC"},{"name":"cf-request-id","value":"0872ec8885000013e447849000000001"},{"name":"expect-ct","value":"max-age=604800, report-uri=\"https://report-uri.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/beacon/expect-ct\""},{"name":"report-to","value":"{\"max_age\":604800,\"endpoints\":[{\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/a.nel.cloudflare.com\\/report?s=sxBP5ehI%2BzvfJXHxh7EWq8yrhfGL9Yl%2FQDKsnmWeWQ2C4vMqel7J0R9i7O1AOBGx36kHE7CGRbBJ2nD38nmWtCM6hDqiwfHwuUpzHzeUbWAb4oE%3D\"}],\"group\":\"cf-nel\"}"},{"name":"nel","value":"{\"report_to\":\"cf-nel\",\"max_age\":604800}"},{"name":"strict-transport-security","value":"max-age=0; includeSubDomains; preload"},{"name":"x-content-type-options","value":"nosniff"},{"name":"server","value":"cloudflare"},{"name":"cf-ray","value":"6264e3873f1e13e4-SEA"}],"content":{"mimeType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","size":74584,"text":"<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?><rss version=\"2.0\"\n\txmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"\n\txmlns:wfw=\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\"\n\txmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\n\txmlns:atom=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"\n\txmlns:sy=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/\"\n\txmlns:slash=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\"\n\t\n\txmlns:georss=\"http://www.georss.org/georss\"\n\txmlns:geo=\"http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#\"\n\t>\n\n<channel>\n\t<title>Live life in Better way with new Technology</title>\n\t<atom:link href=\"https://programesecure.com/feed/\" rel=\"self\" type=\"application/rss+xml\" />\n\t<link>https://programesecure.com</link>\n\t<description>Happy to help</description>\n\t<lastBuildDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 17:45:00 +0000</lastBuildDate>\n\t<language>en-US</language>\n\t<sy:updatePeriod>\n\thourly\t</sy:updatePeriod>\n\t<sy:updateFrequency>\n\t1\t</sy:updateFrequency>\n\t<generator>https://wordpress.org/?v=5.6.2</generator>\n<site xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">130737557</site>\t<item>\n\t\t<title>What&#8217;s going on in esports this week?</title>\n\t\t<link>https://programesecure.com/whats-going-on-in-esports-this-week/</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<comments>https://programesecure.com/whats-going-on-in-esports-this-week/#respond</comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Anurag Chatap]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 17:44:02 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Games]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[esports this week]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://programesecure.com/?p=15464</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>2021 is here, and with it an exciting new time for Esports.

Last year was beset by cancellations, postponements and complications thanks to the ongoing COVID crisis, and though we’re not out of the woods just yet, the future’s looking much brighter than it was before. Many of the events waylaid last year are tentatively scheduled for <em>some point </em>in 2021, like DOTA’s beloved International and the <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2021/01/32508/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><u>CS:GO Major tournaments</u></a> which had a particularly rough time of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But all is not lost &#8211; the competition has still been raging around the globe, and there’s plenty of exciting highlights to catch up on. We’ll take a look in brief at some of this month’s biggest Esports headlines and some upcoming events to keep on your radar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>KARRIGAN MOVES TO FAZE CLAN</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Veteran CS:GO player Finn <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://www.esports.com/en/confirmed-karrigan-makes-move-to-faze-clan-179293\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><u>‘Karrigan’ Andersen will be moving to FaZe</u></a> following olofmeister’s departure. Olofmeister departed following the end of the BLAST Premier Spring Group. Karrigan is an experienced CS:GO player, and was previously at home within FaZe 2016-2019. It’s something of a homecoming for him &#8211; and he’ll be filling a position the team is desperate for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karrigan has done quite a lot for mousesports in his time there &#8211; he brought them to victory in 2019’s CS:GO Asia championships and the ESL Pro League. The two have parted on excellent terms, it seems &#8211; and mousesports wished him all the best in his future endeavours via Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class='youtube-player' width='810' height='456' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/y7ozj9_Wryw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>PRO FORTNITE PLAYER CLIX INDEFINITELY BANNED ON TWITCH</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Prominent Fortnite pro Clix has been banned indefinitely on Twitch after he accidentally streamed a file on his desktop called “Ron’s ass”, with a thumbnail that, well, certainly could well have been Ron’s ass. Whoever Ron is. It’s Clix’s third ban on the platform, which has led some to believe this may be the end for his Twitch channel completely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community has mostly rallied behind him, and it’s called into debate once again Twitch’s obvious double standard for male and female streamers &#8211; they’ve repeatedly let slips and blatant nudity go unpunished for their bigger income streams, and this particular mistake seems a bit too innocent for so drastic a punishment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The #freeclix hashtag blew up on Twitter, and many of the streamer’s fanbase have spoken out in support of what could be seen as a pretty unreasonable ban.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>DIGNITAS GOES UNDEFEATED IN WEEK 2 OF THE LCS</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dignitas have had a particularly dominant week in the League of Legends Championship Series, taking a win from Evil Geniuses. The team is enjoying a <em>lot </em>of success at the moment, thanks to newcomers Soligo and Neo. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much of the spotlight has been on the team’s star jungler, Dardoch, and as both Soligo and Neo are relatively new to the scene, expectations weren’t that high. But now Dignitas is in the running for a top spot, and that’s in no small part thanks to the two newcomers coming into their own as excellent support players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These kinds of upsets are what makes betting on Esports so exciting &#8211; consider <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-calculators/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\">using an odds calculator</a> for Esports to get the advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>SINGAPORE MAJOR ANNOUNCED BY ONE ESPORTS</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The DOTA scene had a particularly rough 2020 with the absence of the beloved International, but they’re back on track &#8211; ONE Esports has announced that the first clash of the world’s best players will take place in Singapore. The tournament will run from March 27th to April 4th, and will be the first-ever Major streamed in 4K and 60fps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’ll feature eighteen teams who’ve qualified through regional leagues. They’re competing for a grand prize of half a million dollars &#8211; so you can bet that after missing out on the International last year, competition is going to be pretty fierce. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Western Europe &amp; China will be seeding four teams, with first seed qualifying for playoffs, the second going to the group stage, and third/fourth qualifying for the Wild Card Stage. South East Asia and Eastern Europe have three teams &#8211; first going to playoffs, second going to group, and the third going to wildcard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>North and South America will see just two teams facing off, with the victor going to the playoffs and second place going into the group stage. With the road to the Major now clear, everything’s to play for.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://programesecure.com/whats-going-on-in-esports-this-week/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">What&#8217;s going on in esports this week?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://programesecure.com\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Live life in Better way with new Technology</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://programesecure.com/whats-going-on-in-esports-this-week/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">15464</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Installation of Under Sink Water Filters</title>\n\t\t<link>https://programesecure.com/installation-of-under-sink-water-filters/</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<comments>https://programesecure.com/installation-of-under-sink-water-filters/#respond</comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Anurag Chatap]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2021 17:33:19 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Home]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[House]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Installation of Under Sink Water Filters]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://programesecure.com/?p=15439</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>The functioning of Under Sink Water Filters Systems Under Sink Water Filters are popular with people who select them for installation in their households.

The filter is fit for kitchens since it is hidden under the sink providing pure drinking water from the sink outlet tap. It is easy to install an <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://www.aquasana.com/under-sink-water-filters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Under Sink Water Filter</a> on any sink to provide a faucet or outlet. A diverter valve is used to divert cold water from the main supply line and direct it to the filter where the filtration process is taking place. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These filters purify water in two segments, the conventional one and the simple filters. There is water coming in from the cold valve and filtered water from the faucet line in the first category. In the other category, there is water coming in and going out through the same line. People may end up filtering more water than required since the water filter functions continuously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Management of Under-sink Filter systems is easy with the automated switch on –offs to avoid water wastage during filtration. Also, the filters have inbuilt replacement alarms if there is a system malfunction enabling the user to detect the defects early. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The filters function like reverse osmosis water filters removing harmful toxins and elements such as calcium, magnesium, arsenic, ammonia, rust, fluoride and others. The process gives out pure, clean water safe for domestic use and drinking. An ideal <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://purewaterguide.net/best-under-sink-water-filters-reviews/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\"><strong>water filter review</strong></a> will help you in identifying the water filter that suits your entire household.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Advantages of Under Sink Water Filter</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Under Sink Water Filters helps remove heavy metals such as rust particles, dust and silt present in water.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://www.raynewater.com/blog/how-to-install-water-filters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Installation of these filters</a> is hidden under the sink providing more space above the counter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These filters help in eliminating harmful bacteria, parasites and amoeba that may be present in water.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under Sink Water Filters gives water better tastes by removing foul odors and smells.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Steps followed during installation.</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Verifying the Valve &#8211; Turning off the cold water supply to the sink is the first thing you should do before starting. Turn the under sink valve to stop the water flow and, using the manufacturer&#8217;s procedure, proceed to the installation process. It is important to note that some cutoff valves that have not been closed in a long time may be stuck in the open from mineral deposits, which calls for water filter professional.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Inbuilt Drills – </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Find out whether the sink you purchased came with predrilled holes for installing ancillary faucets and accessories such as <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://my-best.net/20854\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">toothpaste dispensers</a>. Installation of the filtered faucet component of an under-counter filter is enabled by removing the handy spot that comes closed with plugs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the model you choose to buy, it will determine whether the sink comes with inbuilt drills, or you will have to drill the holes yourself before installing. Granite sinks require a professional stone technician to drill, Porcelain sinks can be drilled using a masonry drill bit, and stainless steel sinks are easy to drill using a standard metal drill bit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check under the sink to ensure that you verify there are no existing obstructions, proceed to pick the spot to the right or left of the existing main faucet. Use a punch, mark the spots first, and apply masking tape over it to ensure the drill doesn&#8217;t damage and skitter the stainless surface.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Avoid over-tightening &#8211; </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After installing the faucet, you are required to add a tee fitting in the cold water line connecting to the sink faucet to aid in diverting water over to the filter. Ensure you do not over-tighten because it can lead to frequent leaks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Identify an accessible spot &#8211; </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before mounting the filter head, ensure you can access it for regular checks by placing it strategically. Lower the screw-on filter canister, which will need ample clearance beneath it to unscrew the canister and remove the replaceable filter cartridge. For easy removal of the canister, position the filter head mounting bracket high enough in the under-counter space.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Check for leaks – </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After connecting everything, screw the canister into the filter head under the counter by placing a fresh filter in the canister. Ensure the standard cold water faucet and the filtered water faucet is closed, open the cold water shutoff valve. Put the system underwater pressure and make an observation to verify there is no leakage in all the appliances.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Flush the filter – </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After installation, ensure the first time you <a href=\"https://programesecure.com/c-generate-pdf-library-that-lets-you-create-c-pdf-programs-in-minutes/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">let the water run for several minutes</a> to flush the filter. The procedure is ideal after every installation of a new filter cartridge that uses standard activated carbon filtration. It helps in flushing carbon fines particles shed by a new filter out of the system. These particles are harmless but may be conspicuous in clear water.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://programesecure.com/installation-of-under-sink-water-filters/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Installation of Under Sink Water Filters</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://programesecure.com\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Live life in Better way with new Technology</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://programesecure.com/installation-of-under-sink-water-filters/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">15439</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Top educational resource for High school students</title>\n\t\t<link>https://programesecure.com/top-educational-resource-for-high-school-students/</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<comments>https://programesecure.com/top-educational-resource-for-high-school-students/#respond</comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Anurag Chatap]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2021 03:28:45 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Educations]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Top educational resource for High school students]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://programesecure.com/?p=15426</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Studies suggest that learning resources are very significant for academic achievement for students.

It is very hard to find a balance between family, sports, work, friends, leisure&#8230; And if we add the desire to improve to the mixture and to be more productive and efficient, having time for other things seems impossible. But don&#8217;t stress! Today we want to share several productivity tips that will transform your daily reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Productivity at work is the amount of profitable work done in a given time. This amount of useful work should be at the maximum possible and should be increasing over time to make the most out of your working hours, whether you work for yourself or others. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In times when new technologies, stress, and other causes constantly interfere with your performance, it is important to know <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://www.15five.com/blog/4-scientifically-proven-methods-increase-productivity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">how to increase productivity</a> at work and make your daily tasks profitable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Productivity has become a problem for many companies and freelancers. At first, workers and employers are motivated and productivity is not affected. However, when a stable dynamic is achieved, productivity begins to suffer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What can be done to avoid it? How to improve your work so that performance does not decrease? Well, this is achievable with the right motivation, constant communication, continuous training, and a good organization. Check out the following <a href=\"https://programesecure.com/last-minute-jee-preparation-tips/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">tips and make your work</a> life a lot more productive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sleep Well and get up Early</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the simplest and most natural <a href=\"https://programesecure.com/increase-employee-productivity-with-a-chat-system/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">way to be more productive</a>. How many times have you stayed up working late thinking that this way you will achieve more or you stayed up watching one more episode of your favorite series? It is really as easy as it sounds, if you sleep well and wake up early, you will do much better than working non-stop all day or working late at night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how many hours a night sleep is good for you? This depends on the person, but the recommendation is to sleep more than 6 hours and up to 8 hours at the most &#8220;normal&#8221; times possible which is between 10 pm. and 8 am.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our brain has different peak performances during the day so it is important to identify those peaks and develop activities that allow us to make the most of the time of greater clarity. So, for example, it will be more productive to fall asleep at 11 pm. and get up at 7 am. to have a super productive hour at the beginning of the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it will be less productive if you stay up by 12 pm. doing some work because it is more likely that what you are trying to solve at night, with a good rest you will solve it the morning in less time. Let’s not forget that it is possible to wake up with all the answers to the questions that were bothering you the day before thanks to your brain thinking about it while you were asleep.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Keep Distractions to a Minimum</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Distractions are the greatest enemy of productivity at work. In order to combat them first, it is necessary to identify them. These distractions can be divided into: distractions caused by different communication tools (let’s say: your mobile phone), distractions caused by other people (for example: your coworkers), and last but not least internal distractions (those distractions related to your thoughts and your personal life ).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To avoid them, as we have mentioned, you must identify them first and then try to cut them off. You can turn off your mobile while working on an important task, work with headphones so that your colleagues do not interrupt you, solve personal problems in your free time so that they do not interfere with your work tasks, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Use Technology for Your Advantage not for Procrastination</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We already talked about how distracting technology can be, but on the other hand, it can <a href=\"https://programesecure.com/9-best-mac-tips-tricks-save-time/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">save you an unbelievable amount of time</a> if used properly. And by using properly we don’t mean spending your day scrolling through social media feed, watching YouTube videos, or <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://www.agame.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">playing online games</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know that there are many online tools that can streamline your daily processes, help you cut other distractions, and help you work more productively? Below we will mention some of our favorite productivity tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://easypdf.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><u>EasyPDF</u></a> &#8211; This tool can be a lifesaver if you deal with a lot of PDF documents on a regular basis.

To work you have to immerse yourself in a task and avoid distractions. But, it is impossible to stay focused during the entire working day! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all need breaks and to be disconnected from time to time. Therefore, it is advisable to organize tasks in blocks and rest between them. Numerous studies claim that breaks are beneficial for performance, necessary to reactivate the brain, and essential to tackle new tasks with energy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Plan Today for Tomorrow</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to increase productivity is to plan for each day. When your workday is over, spend around 10 minutes organizing your schedule for the next day. It will prevent you from <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://theconversation.com/dont-know-what-day-it-is-or-who-said-what-at-the-last-meeting-blame-the-coronavirus-142086\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">forgetting tasks, meetings</a>, or important dates, and you will establish a schedule and even take time to rest. In addition, you will know what you have to start the day with and you will not waste a moment in deciding or making decisions, because you already have everything prepared in advance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do Less &#8211; Only What’s Important</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When making your daily plan of things that you have to do, at work or in your business, do the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Make a list of all of the activities you plan to do.</li><li>Ask yourself:</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Which of these activities are the most important?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which of these activities, if I didn&#8217;t do today, wouldn&#8217;t affect my most important goals?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which of these activities, if I never did, wouldn&#8217;t affect my most important goals?</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Once you have eliminated unimportant activities with the mentioned questions, compare the activities you have left with each other and order them according to their importance.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Avoid Multitasking and Do One Thing at a Time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever heard that multitasking is not a power, it is a weakness? To increase productivity and get the best results, you need to focus on a single task. Multitasking makes you think you do more at the same time, but in reality, it undermine your ability to complete tasks efficiently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, multitasking can reduce productivity by 40%. In addition, there are studies that claim that dedicating yourself to one <a href=\"https://programesecure.com/things-must-have-for-improving-the-quality-of-your-life/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">thing at a time is able to improve</a> the ability to switch from one task to another in a more productive way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reduce the Number of Participants in Meetings</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want to have more productive meetings? Then simply call only the people who are involved in the project and please don&#8217;t call the whole neighborhood and departments to attend. The more people in the meeting, the more chaotic the meeting can be, and the easier it is for it to end up being more of a waste of time than a productive meeting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is best to only call the people with whom you <a href=\"https://programesecure.com/really-need-kids-gps-watch/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">really need</a> to exchange projects and new ideas. There is also a 2 pizza rule which states that if 2 large pizzas are not enough to feed everyone at the meeting then you have more people in the meeting than you should.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do the Difficult Tasks First</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To beat procrastination, <a href=\"https://programesecure.com/frequently-asked-questions-regarding-kids-early-learning-centre/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">learn to tackle less pleasant tasks early</a> in the morning, rather than leaving them for the end of the day or even the day after. This simple approach will allow you to have a great productive day, and you will not feel bad when the night comes, for having stopped doing what is necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We hope that you will apply these productivity tips in your daily work and that you found them useful. Remember that there are many changes to be made, so go one by one in order to have good results.

The first thing we were taught was the full form of HTML. Still many of us don’t remember it. So what is HTML? What does HTML stand for? Well, HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is a kind of formatting system that is used to display the information that has been retrieved from the webpages/ internet. The unit or the information retrieved is known as the webpage i.e. the material retrieved from the World Wide Web. Web Pages include hypertext links that help in retrieving the information. These hypertext links are a part of HTML.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/full-form-of-html.png\" alt=\"Full Form of HTML\" class=\"wp-image-34501\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In layman’s language, HTML is defined as a code that is used to make a webpage, its content, and if all the content is lost; HTML links help us to retrieve the information. There are many elements included in HTML which one can use to enclose a particular paragraph or content. The enclosing tabs help in a great way. These tags can create word or image links that will help in structuring the content in a certain way. Let us look at an example:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Daniel is my best friend.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this is the content that we have written; then we can enclose it in the paragraph tags like:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">&lt;p&gt;Daniel is my best friend&lt;/p&gt;</pre>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/html-full-form.png\" alt=\"Full Form of HTML\" class=\"wp-image-34502\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is how we write HTML coding and in this way, the links are generated. Now, let us look at the paragraph closely. There are four main elements of the content in HTML.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>The Opening Tag</strong>: The Opening Tag is used to specify that the content has begun. In the above case, we have specified it with the help of paragraph tags thereby including opening and closing brackets.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>The Closing Tag</strong>: The Closing Tag is used to specify that the content/ paragraph have been finished. We end the paragraph by including tags and a slash in front of it. If we do not enter the slash in the paragraph tags then we can end up having strange results. It is important to state that the content has been ended.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Content</strong>: Now, what is content? The sentence which is between the opening and the closing tag is called content.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Element:</strong> The sentence along with the opening and the closing tags altogether is called an element.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Attribute</strong>: Attribute is one of the important parts of an HTML link. Attributes contain some extra information regarding the element. It is the information that we do not want to appear in the content. One must keep in mind the following things to write an attribute:</li><li>A certain space must be maintained between an attribute and an element.</li><li>The attribute name must have an equal sign.</li><li>The attribute value must be enclosed with the opening and closing quotation marks.</li><li>Characters like <strong>“ ‘ , = &lt; &gt;</strong> must also be quoted. If they remain unquoted the code would remain inconsistent.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with these elements, there are some Nesting Elements. Now, what are the Nesting Elements? When we can put additional elements in the content, then it is called nesting. For instance, the dog is very grumpy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we can enclose the word ‘very’ with the element &lt;strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us look at the coding.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">&lt;p&gt; the dog is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy. &lt;/p&gt;&nbsp;</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Here you can see that the element strong is nested correctly. We have to make sure that the opening and closing elements are properly nested. If there is any change in the coding, the browser will give strange and unexpected results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us have a look at the entire coding.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">&lt;html>\n &lt;body>\n &lt;h1>first heading&lt;/h1>\n &lt;p>paragraph. &lt;/p>\n &lt;/body>\n &lt;/html></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This is how the HTML coding works. HTML is a programming language which is used to create web pages and maintain it in a certain way. The tags that we use in the coding are used to specify different things. For instance, if we wish to insert an image in the paragraph, we will use the tag &lt;img&gt;. Similarly, to include a heading we will insert the tag &lt;h1&gt; or &lt;h2&gt; depending upon the content we are writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing has to be kept in mind i.e. the tags must be properly opened and closed in other to achieve the result. Thus, HTML is one programming language that is used by web page creators to maintain them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/full-form-of-html/\">Full Form of HTML</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com\">Tutorial And Example </a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Full Form of HR</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.tutorialandexample.com/full-form-of-hr/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[admin]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 06:50:04 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Full Form]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.tutorialandexample.com/?p=34491</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>HR Full Form The employees of the company are the assets to the company.

The employees are the invaluable resources through which the company yields profits. The full form of HR is Human Resources. This is a term that is used for specifying the work-force of the organization. Human Resource is also considered as the business division in which certain programs are listed like screening, recruiting, training, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, who recruits the candidates under the HR department? The Manager of the company recruits the work-force of the organization. The manager who recruits the candidates is called the HR Manager. Well, it is interesting to note that the HRM i.e. the Human Resources Management is the primary or the most important department in the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Full-Form-of-HR.png\" alt=\"Full Form of HR\" class=\"wp-image-34495\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let us see some of the functions of HR.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>An HR is responsible for hiring the work-force in an organization.</li><li>Through incentives and promotions, HR motivates the employees.</li><li>The HR is also responsible for training the candidates thereby contributing to the development of the individuals.</li><li>If an individual has a problem regarding anything in the company, he/ she can contact HR. The HR will counsel and handle the problem.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In other terms, the HR department is responsible for managing and maintaining the life cycle of an employee (recruiting, training, onboarding, etc.).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, you must be wondering how one gets employed in the company. Well, one has to undergo an HR interview. In this interview round, the strength and the personality of an individual are tested. Apart from that the capability to handle certain situations is also tested in this job. HR interview can be a stressful interview as many stressful situations are provided by the recruiters. If the recruiters feel that you are fit for the job; you get it. But one has to be prepared if he/ she wants to clear this round. HR has five main roles to play. These roles are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Ensuring workplace safety</li><li>HR Compliance</li><li>Compensation and Benefits</li><li>Talent Management</li><li>Training and developing the candidates</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The staff working under the HR department has to fulfill these five roles. Apart from the roles, there are certain responsibilities that they have. In addition to the above-mentioned functions, the other responsibilities include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Recruiting the candidates who fit in the desired role provided to them.</li><li>Setting up policies and updating them from time to time. This will be beneficial for the individuals as well as the company.</li><li>Providing rewards and appraisal to the individual from time to time so that they are motivated to work in a positive environment.</li><li>Retaining the employees of the company and ensuring that they feel safe in the working conditions of the company.</li><li>Training the employees which will result in individual development.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>These are some of the additional functions of an HR. An HR plays an important role in the development and reinforcement of the laws and policies of the company. An HR is capable of changing the culture of an organization. The roles and functions of an HR are already listed above. Being an HR is a difficult task as maintaining a good workplace environment and changing the culture is not easy. An HR has to perform many roles and has many responsibilities upon him/ her. Human Resources can be considered as the heart of the company. Taking care of the employee needs is the primary task of HR. They also make sure that the work is carried out smoothly and efficiently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the academic field, if one studies HR; then he/ she can apply for any job. There is job diversity in HR. There are many skills that you can acquire i.e. multi-tasking, administration, reporting, communication, and much more. MBA is one such course in which HR is the main subject. In terms of job, the Chief HR Officer is the highest position in the HR department. Rest all others work under the Chief HR Officer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it is important to note that HR has many roles and responsibilities to fulfill. Out of the roles, ensuring employee safety is the primary role of HR. Whenever a problem arises in the company; HR has the responsibility of sorting it out. HR has to ensure that the working conditions are positive. Thus, HR has many roles to play which makes them the heart of the company.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/full-form-of-hr/\">Full Form of HR</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com\">Tutorial And Example </a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Full Form of FUP</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.tutorialandexample.com/fup-full-form/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[admin]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 06:35:44 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Full Form]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.tutorialandexample.com/?p=34483</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>FUP Full Form All of us might not know the meaning of FUP.

Well, FUP stands for ‘Fair Usage Policy’ which is seen in various recharge plans of JIO. Now, what is a ‘Fair Usage Policy’? A FUP is a kind of artificial restriction that is imposed so that the data does not get transferred to any other network. These restrictions are the policies that are imposed upon by the service providers to ensure that the usage of the data and services are limited. FUP is also known as Data Cap or Bandwidth Cap. These FUPs provide fair services to their users.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FUP-Full-Form.png\" alt=\"FUP Full Form\" class=\"wp-image-34485\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, FUP may also mean that if a user crosses the limit of calling or texting, he/ she will be charged the next minute. For instance, in Reliance–JIO, if an individual has taken a Rs 199 plan then the FUP limit is 300 minutes for calling. After this limit has been finished or crossed, the person will be charged accordingly or will have to get a recharge done (the talk time will be stopped). Not only the calling, but the internet speed is also reduced when the data pack is finished. Having said that, in the Rs 199 plan, a total of 42 GB of data is provided (1.5GB Data per day) in which the speed is 64kbps. This plan is for 28 days wherein the calling is free for JIO to JIO users. If a JIO user calls a Non – JIO user, then he/ she will be charged accordingly (the FUP limit is 1,000 minutes). It is also important to note that, the internet speed, as well as the calling speed, is high in all the plans along with 100 free SMSes. The Fair Usage Policy is subjected to unlimited calling to various other networks. Now, let us look at some of the FUP plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>MAXIMUM RETAIL PRICE (MRP)</strong></td><td><strong>PLANS &amp; BENEFITS</strong></td><td><strong>VALIDITY</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Rs. 185</td><td>2GB data per day i.e. 56 GB, 100 SMS free + unlimited calls</td><td>28 Days</td></tr><tr><td>Rs. 155</td><td>1 GB per day i.e. 28 GB, unlimited calls + 100 SMS free</td><td>28 Days</td></tr><tr><td>Rs. 125</td><td>A total of 14 GB is provided, unlimited calls + 300 SMS free</td><td>28 Days</td></tr><tr><td>Rs. 75</td><td>A total of 3GB is provided followed by unlimited calling and 50 SMS free</td><td>28 Days</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These are some of the plans provided by Reliance–Jio and you can see the FUP provided in each plan. Out of these plans, Rs. 125 plan is the most popular as it is affordable and the FUP provided is also good. In case, someone wants a higher data plan, then they can go with Rs. 155 and Rs. 185 plans which are also beneficial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, there is an interesting point to note i.e. JIO has come up with the latest plan of Rs. 49 wherein, one will receive a total of 2 GB data, unlimited calling, and 25 SMS. This plan is valid for 14 days and the FUP provided is 250 minutes for calling (JIO to Non–JIO). This plan has been released so that people can afford it along with the JIO phone. Reliance–JIO through its plans has won the ‘Mobile War’. Their plans are affordable and within the reach of everyone. There is also a plan of Rs. 69 in which a total of 7 GB data is provided followed by unlimited calling and 250 FUP minutes (JIO to Non–JIO). This plan is also valid for 14 days. According to some reports, Reliance–JIO has a quarterly profit of 504 Crores. The revenue for the same was Rs. 6,897 Crores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plans for JIO range from Rs. 399 to Rs. 8,499 in which the maximum FUP limit is 3300GB depending upon the plan. Well, all the plans and the FUP limits are good enough. One has to choose an affordable plan for themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talking in terms of other networks, BSNL is also one of the best networks in which the FUP limit is 500GB. The FUP speed is said to be 10Mbps and the plans range from Rs. 949 to Rs. 1,499. There are many other networks as well that provide plans and relative FUP limit. One has to choose which network or broadband service they require.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, if we closely look at network services, Reliance–JIO is the most beneficial because the plans are affordable, the FUP limit is good and the data provided is also fine. There are many other packs in JIO. Thus, if you need to have affordable plans and good FUP then, you need to choose from the best network service providers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/fup-full-form/\">Full Form of FUP</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com\">Tutorial And Example </a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>DSLR Full Form</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.tutorialandexample.com/dslr-full-form/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[admin]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 06:23:28 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Full Form]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.tutorialandexample.com/?p=34476</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>DSLR Full Form What is a DSLR?

Many of us have DSLR cameras nowadays, but how many of us know the true meaning or the full form of this abbreviation. Not many! We are using these products and we know them through their short forms. So let’s discuss what DSLR is and what is its full form and meaning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, the full form of DSLR is Digital Single-lens Reflex Camera. It can be called DSLR or Digital SLR. It is one of the finest forms of technology that we have today. Photographers, Designers, etc have these DSLR cameras to put forth their talent in various industries. This digital camera is capable of combining the optics with the mechanism of the lens with the help of the digital imaging sensor. A DSLR camera includes the following parts:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Camera Lens</li><li>ReflexMirror</li><li>Focal–Plane Shutter</li><li>Image Sensor</li><li>Matte Focusing Screen</li><li>Condenser Lens</li><li>Pentaprism or Pentamirror</li><li>Viewfinder eyepiece</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the crucial parts of a DSLR camera and the photographer must know why each part is required for. These parts are crucial in terms of taking both a mirror image and a plane image. Now, you must be wondering what is the difference between the DSLR camera and other digital cameras? Well, the only difference between a DSLR and other digital cameras is the reflex design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, what happens in a reflex design? Well, in this design the light travels through the lens which is followed by traveling through the mirror. After the light travels, the image captured is sent to a prism through which we can see the image in the viewfinder. The DSLR camera does not use a secondary lens. Rather the viewfinder presents the image which is captured by the sensor. The sensor presents an optical view of the image. It is important to note that the DSLR camera has replaced the film-based SLRs from the year 2000.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DSLR-Full-Form.png\" alt=\"DSLR Full Form\" class=\"wp-image-34479\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let us look at some of the key features of DSLR cameras.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Mode Dial:</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The DSLR cameras have mode dials (also called as ‘PASM’ dial) which help largely in the camera scene–mode settings. There are certain modes in DSLR camera like aperture–priority, shutter–priority, manual modes, etc. The modes differ from camera to camera. The scene modes of a DSLR camera include landscape, portrait, action, night, silhouette, and others.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Dust Reduction System:</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The first DSLR i.e. Sigma SD9 introduced a method of preventing dust from entering the lens. Olympus Corporation built the sensor cleaning mechanism in Sigma SD9. With the help of these dust reducing systems, the DSLR is less prone to damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Interchanging of Lens:</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best features of a DSLR camera is that it has interchangeable lenses. One can choose from the given lenses which will be fit for the current photography. Apart from the primary lens, there are special lenses that can be attached to the camera to provide the perfect shot. Due to this feature, DSLR cameras are becoming popular. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Live Preview:</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The DSLRs which are manufactured now have the ability of a live review. The live review is useful in underwater photography wherein the viewfinder cannot be put to use. In such situations, the camera is in a waterproof case and provides the optical image.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Better Image Quality:</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>With the help of large sensors, the quality of the photograph improves. Image sensors come in various sizes. The large sensors are used for capturing medium format images. Both small and large sensors are used in getting the best quality photograph. The sensors of the cameras are measured in megapixels. The cameras with large sensors tend to have better megapixel ratings. Thus, to have better image quality, large sensors are used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a lot of difference between the DSLR and other digital cameras. The sensor size varies, the performance varies and the optical views and digitally created image also differs. The DSLRs of the early period and the present time vary in functions and parts. For instance, there were no interchangeable lenses or dust reducing systems in the early models of DSLRs. But now, the product and the models both have changed. Thus, if anyone wants to have better quality images then one must invest in these DSLR cameras. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/dslr-full-form/\">DSLR Full Form</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com\">Tutorial And Example </a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>DGP Full Form</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.tutorialandexample.com/dgp-full-form/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[admin]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 06:14:24 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Full Form]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.tutorialandexample.com/?p=34473</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>DGP Full Form Who is DGP or what is DGP?

We have come across certain situations during interviews or casual conversations wherein people ask the full form of DGP. Well, the abbreviation DGP stands for the Director-General of Police. A DGP is ranked as the highest police official or officer in a state or a territory. DGP has the responsibility of looking over the matters of the state thereby; making sure that no crime takes place in that particular state. The Cabinet appoints the DGP for looking after the state or the territory. A Cabinet is a body of government officials who appoint the inspectors, sub-inspectors, and constables. Cabinet Ministers or Secretaries fall under the category of Cabinets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it is interesting to note that a DGP carries three stars on his/ her uniform which is the sign of good performance by an individual for guarding the state. The DGP officers also wear Gorget Patches. If we closely look at their uniform, one can see the national emblem and a cross-sword followed by a baton. This is the rank insignia of the Director-General of Police.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;There are additional officers who hold the rank of a DGP in a particular state or territory. These officers are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Director of Vigilance</li><li>Anti-Corruption Bureau</li><li>Director-General of Prison</li><li>Director-General of Fire Forces and Civil Defence</li><li>Criminal Investigation Department</li><li>Police Housing Society</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These are some of the roles that the DGP rank holds. A person having a DGP rank can have any of the above-mentioned roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A DGP is the gazetted officer. We often get confused between IG and DGP. Both Director General of Police and Inspector General of Police are the same. Every state or territory is headed by a DGP or an IG officer. A DGP can exercise the power of an Executive Magistrate and other functions likewise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, if we talk about the salary structure of a DGP then, it would be Rs.75,000/- – Rs.80,000/- per month according to the 7<sup>th</sup> pay commission as given by the Government of India.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us now look at some of the key responsibilities of a DGP. A DGP is considered to be the advisor of the Government who has the right to put forth his/ her opinion on the Police administration matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since a DGP is the head of the state, he also has one more responsibility i.e. keeping the police force under discipline and training them. This should be done by the DGP in order to ensure law and order both in the state and among the force. Moreover, a DGP can issue orders but only after taking permission/ approval by the Government of India.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever there are disputes within the state, be it political, industrial, or personal; the DGP looks out for a solution so that the peace is maintained within the state. At a certain point of time when riots or strikes break out, a DGP has the power to direct and control such operations. An officer who ranks as the DGP has a lot of responsibilities on him/ her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a DGP has to attend a meeting or have to go on official tours; the Chief Minister has to be informed primarily. So, these are some of the functions and responsibilities that are upon a DGP. And these responsibilities are not for DGP; rather these responsibilities and functions are followed by the other superior officers like IAS, IPS, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, there is one interesting fact to know about the Director-General of Police. In addition to the above-mentioned roles in this article, a DGP also has certain roles in the Central Government. These additional roles are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Director</li><li>Director of SVPNPA (Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy)</li><li>Director General at CRPF (Central Reserve Police Force)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These three are additional roles that a DGP has to fulfill. A DGP has to take care of the state and is, therefore, responsible for maintaining peace within the state. A DGP is awarded based on his/ her performance. The Director-General of Police is also responsible for handling the strikes or riots in the state or territory. Thus, a DGP is a high-ranking officer having certain roles and responsibilities to fulfill. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/dgp-full-form/\">DGP Full Form</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com\">Tutorial And Example </a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Full Form of GST</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.tutorialandexample.com/full-form-of-gst/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[admin]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2021 09:56:50 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Full Form]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.tutorialandexample.com/?p=34455</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Full Form of GST GST is one of the most revolutionary tax reforms that is being introduced in our country since independence.

It eradicated all the problems and the constant changes that were made to taxes with each financial year. But learning more about GST, first learn what does GST stands for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The full form of the financial abbreviation GST is Goods and Services Tax.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Full-Form-of-GST-1-1.png\" alt=\"Full Form of GST\" class=\"wp-image-34462\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This tutorial will briefly cover about the definitions, history, types of GST, its advantages, disadvantages, commodities not subject to GST and other detailed information related to ICU or <strong><em>Goods and Services Tax</em></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-what-is-gst\">What is GST?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Full-Form-of-GST-2-1.png\" alt=\"Full Form of GST\" class=\"wp-image-34463\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;“<strong><em>Goods and Services Tax or GST is a single indirect tax launched by the Government of India on the supply of goods and services unlike such as food, clothes, items of daily needs, transportation etc.</em></strong>”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GST is an indirect tax that consumers have to pay while purchasing any goods, commodities, or services, such as meals, garments, electronics devices, everyday requirements, transport, shipping, travel, etc. The notion of GST is that it is an <strong>&#8220;Indirect Tax</strong>&#8220;, i.e., where the consumers don&#8217;t pay the tax directly to the government but on their behalf, the manufacturer, retailer or providers of services pay it. The sellers normally add the tax amount into their charges, and the amount the consumers pay include GST. Thus, the customer ends up paying a tax even if they don&#8217;t fall in the income taxpayer category.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Government collects taxes for its functioning and for maintaining the country&#8217;s revenue source. But earlier, the tax was imposed directly on the income of individuals. Thus, it leads to a cascade effect where tax was paid at every stage in the chain flow. Let’s understand the concept of the cascading effect through an example:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example: </strong>A wholesaler sells a good at the cost of price Rs. 112 to a retailer wherein Rs 100 is the product&#8217;s actual price and Rs 12 is the 12% tax amount. Further, the retailer sells the same good to the consumers at Rs 126, where Rs 112 would be the base price and Rs 14 is the 12% GST amount. Hence, because of the cascading effect of taxes, the customer has to buy an expensive product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To resolve these problems and eliminate the cascading effect, GST was introduced. It is designed to induce all the indirect taxes under one umbrella where the tax will be paid only at the final point of consumption.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-who-introduced-gst-in-india\">Who introduced GST in India?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On the midnight of July 1, 2017, <strong>India&#8217;s Prime Minister Narendra Modi marked the most historical movement by launching GST</strong>. It took the BJP government almost two decades to implement the concept of GST in the nation since the concept was first proposed under the presidency of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The progression of GST accompanied many meetings, discussions, amendments and reviews before it was finally launched in 2017. The nationwide GST implementation also got delayed because it needed a Constitutional Amendment, two-thirds majority support in the Indian Parliament, and an acceptance of at least half of the total Indian states.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-types-of-gst\">Types of GST</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>CGST or Central Goods and Services Tax</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>CGST is the tax imposed on intrastate supplies goods, services and product distribution where the tax rate is less or equal to 14%. CGST covers Excise duty taxes on Hospitals &amp; Toiletries Preparation Act, Central Excise tax, Services Tax, Additional Excise Duty tax, Countervailing Duty tax etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>SGST or State Goods and Services Tax</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>SGST tax is imposed on goods and services rendered within an Indian state’s borders and are governed by the SGST act. The act includes several state taxes, such as luxury tax, state income tax, border entry tax, entertainment tax, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>IGST or Integrated Goods and Services Tax</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>IGST is the tax levies for the international transportation of goods and services. For example, the commodities are exchanged among two states (like the goods are traded between Tamil Nadu &amp; West Bengal, the IGST will be applicable). IGST is levied on all kinds of imports &amp; exports goods &amp; services from India.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-commodities-not-subjected-to-gst\">Commodities not subjected to GST</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The List of several items that does not come under GST is as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>First, Meat or Fillets</li><li>Alive birds &amp; animals</li><li>Trees &amp; alive plants</li><li>Alcohol, Beer &amp; Drinks</li><li>Manures &amp; Fertilizers</li><li>Beverages including Coffee &amp; Teas</li><li>Pulses, Spices&nbsp;</li><li>Dry fruits</li><li>Fruits &amp; Vegetables</li><li>Eatable grains</li><li>Musical &amp; Industrial tools</li><li>Pharmaceutical Drugs &amp; Medicines</li><li>Claws &amp; hooves.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-advantages-of-gst\">Advantages of GST</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Full-Form-of-GST-3-1.png\" alt=\"Full Form of GST\" class=\"wp-image-34464\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Every coin has two aspects, head (positive) or tails (negative).

Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS), is a certified medical degree in medical science which gives license to an aspirant to operate surgeries and practice medicine.</em></strong>”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MBBS is derived from the Latin language&nbsp;<em><strong>Medicinae Baccalaureus Baccalaureus Chirurgiae</strong></em>. It is a professional course that is completed in five years and six months. It also includes a mandate internship of one year in any hospital, government nursing homes, health camps, and NGO’s. ) To get admission in government MBBS and reputed private colleges, the candidates must qualify for the NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) entrance exam with the required percentile. National Testing Agency or NTA conducts NEET every year to take eligible students.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MBBS allows the medical science student to establish their career in any of the following medical streams:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Nephrology</li><li>&nbsp;Cardiology</li><li>Gynecology</li><li>&nbsp;Anesthesiology</li><li>&nbsp;Organ Transplant</li><li>Endocrine</li><li>General Surgery</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The overviews of MBBS are as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Degrees Offered</td><td>1.

These subjects include pre and para-medical subjects unlike pathology, biochemistry, microbiology, cardiology, anatomy, physiology, forensic medication including toxicology and pharmaceutical. The students also do practical training for five years to assist doctors, practice on real-time patients and learn clinical care. The course has pre-defined standard protocols and structure, where they study history taking, give examination, create various synopsis, do diagnosis and complete patient Management. The pursuers are trained to discover what investigations will help a patient and their best medicine substitutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The curriculum also includes precise understanding and practice of performing standard clinical systems. They get exposure to ward management abilities, staff administration, and counseling experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-requirements-for-mbbs\">Requirements for MBBS</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The requirements to apply for the MBBS course are that the applicant must be from a science background and obtain at least 50% aggregate (for general category) in physics, chemistry, biology and English in higher secondary examinations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For other categories, the requirement is reduced to 40% aggregate. The seats in government MBBS colleges are limited in India. The students have to qualify for the exam of NEET (National Eligibility cum entrance test) to get admission in MBBS college.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on their ranks, the college and seats are allocated. Even many private colleges appoint students by their NEET rank. However, the government is scheming to come up with new medical colleges in 58 districts of India. The new colleges will secure 5,800 more MBBS seats in the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-myths-about-mbbs\">Myths about MBBS</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Clearing cut-off books your seat in the MBBS college</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It is one of the common disbelief that is held by most of the students. They believe clearing the NEET exam is a confirmation to their admission in a MBBS college. But this is so not true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearing NEET exam is the first step that’s makes the applicant eligible to sit in the further counseling rounds.&nbsp; There many high end colleges which conduct their own entrance examination and have their separate cut-off list.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>NEET is hard to crack</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Great things never come easy and competitive exams are one of them. Though it is tough but strong determination, hard work, and routinely study can help you to achieve the goal. These examinations are conducted to hunt the deserving candidate who dreams themselves as a doctor and will do anything for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Students pursuing MBBS have no social life</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>An old proverb says “All work and no play make jack a dull boy”. That’s true your social life is very important to sustain a healthy life. MBBS doesn’t mean to eliminate you from your social life. There are plenty of students who have pursued their hobbies, chilled with their friends and simultaneously have excelled in their career. Its all about your time management skills and determination.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>MBBS pursuers have limited career options.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Millions of people consider that the only career option for an MBBS pursuer is to be a doctor. The fact is they never explore the various career possibilities that one can pursue after MBBS degrees. They have as many available options as an engineer or MBA pursuer, unlike Hospital Management, General Management, Domain Consultant, Healthcare Administration, they can also prepare for Civil Services exams ( IAS, IFS, IPS). They can even learn to code and join Medical IT or Software Programming).</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It takes forever to become a doctor</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Rome wasn’t built in a day. Though time in a vital factor but a career like MBBS (doctor) worth your time. You have to invest 11 years of your life to become a successful and professional doctor.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The fastest and safest way to be rich</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It takes years of mastery to be a professional doctor, handles critical cases, saves precious lives, and collects priceless blessings from the patients who came back to life by fighting a fatal battle with their diseases by your conscious medicaments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Undoubtedly MBBS is a white color job, and an experienced doctor enjoys a high salary, a massive reputation and colossal respect in society. But in the early stages, you have to go through a lot of struggle and hard work without any financial perks.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>MBBS is a degree for higher class families</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To get admission in any high-end college courses, you require to deposit handsome college fees in today&#8217;s era. But, it is also inevitably true that these benchmarks are only for private colleges. Government colleges&#8217; fees are still pocket-friendly and easily affordable by middle class or lower-middle-class families. Even if they can&#8217;t afford it, they can easily get a student loan from any bank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But to secure admission in Government medical college by clearing NEET is not a piece of cake. It takes strong determination, dedication and hours of study to get admission in a top-class government college with an affordable price structure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Frequently Asked Question</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question 1: How can a candidate seek admission in MBBS College?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>: &nbsp;To get admission in a government MBBS college (also applicable for some reputed private colleges), the candidates require to qualify for the NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) entrance exam with the required percentile. National Testing Agency or NTA conducts NEET every year to take eligible students. Clearing the NEET exam doesn’t secure their MBBS college position as it is only an entry pass for the next round. After qualifying for the exam, the candidates have to undergo a centralized counseling procedure organized by the Directorate General of Health Sciences (DGHS) on behalf of the Medical Counselling Committee (MCC). If they succeed in the counseling round, they can only get admission to government MBBS college.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question 2: Is it mandate to be from the Science stream to pursue MBBS?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes, it is mandatory for all applicants who want to sit in the NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) entrance exam or any other medical exam to have P, C, B (Physics, Chemistry and Biology) as their subject in their higher-secondary. The Medical Council of India has made this criterion compulsory to secure a medical seat.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/what-is-mbbs/\">What is MBBS</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com\">Tutorial And Example </a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Constructor Program in Java</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.tutorialandexample.com/constructor-program-in-java/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[admin]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2021 08:55:21 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[java]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.tutorialandexample.com/?p=34439</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Constructor Program in Java In Java, a constructor is a piece of code that is used to create an object.

A constructor looks like an instance method. However, a constructor and an instance method are two different things. A Java constructor is often regarded as a special type of method in Java. <strong>Constructor program in Java</strong> tells about how to use constructors in a program. <strong>Constructors always have the same name as the name of the class</strong>. Whenever a new object is created in Java, the constructor initializes that object. A class may or may not contain more than one constructor. The following rules must be followed to define a constructor in Java</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1) Constructor name and class name should always match.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2) No return type should be given to a Java constructor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3) Keywords like synchronized, static, native, final, and abstract should not be used with a Java constructor. However, access specifiers like private, protected, public can be used with a constructor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Constructor Program in Java</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following program demonstrates how to create an array and display its elements on the console.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FileName:</strong> ConstructorExample.java</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">public class ConstructorExample\n {\n // Constructor\n ConstructorExample()\n {\n     // print statement\n     System.out.println(\"Inside the constructor of the class ConstructorExample. \");\n }\n public static void main(String argvs[])\n {\n     // creating two objects obj of the class ConstructorExample\n     ConstructorExample obj1 = new ConstructorExample();\n     ConstructorExample obj2 = new ConstructorExample();\n }\n }</pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">Inside the constructor of the class ConstructorExample.\n Inside the constructor of the class ConstructorExample.</pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> We see that there are two statements in the output but only one print statement in the code. This is because the calling of a constructor is dependent upon the number of times the objects are created. In the code, we have used the keyword new twice. Thus, two times the constructor is called, and two objects of the class <em>ConstructorExample</em> is created. <em>ConstructorExample()</em> written after the new keyword is responsible for the constructor invoking. Note that a constructor always returns the reference of the object created. obj1 and obj2 holds the reference returned by the constructor <em>ConstructorExample()</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Types of Constructor in Java</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three types of constructor in Java</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1) Default constructor</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2) No argument constructor</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3) Parameterized constructor</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Default Constructor</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s see what happens if we remove the code of constructor in the above example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FileName:</strong> ConstructorExample.java</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">public class ConstructorExample\n {\n public static void main(String argvs[])\n {\n     // creating two objects obj of the class ConstructorExample\n     ConstructorExample obj1 = new ConstructorExample();\n     ConstructorExample obj2 = new ConstructorExample();\n }\n }</pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we compile and run the above program, it does not show the output because there is no print statement in the program. However, the code is compiled and executed perfectly. Because the Java compiler implicitly inserts a default constructor in the code during the compilation of the program. It is not visible to user. Therefore, when <em>ConstructorExample(),</em> written after the <em>new </em>keyword, the default constructor is called. Hence, there is no error while executing the code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, the default constructor inserted by the Java compiler is:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">ConstructorExample()\n {\n }</pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Java compiler never inserts the default constructor when a constructor is defined in the code. Thedefault constructors always get the access specifier of the class for which they are defined. In the above code, the class <em>ConstructorExample</em> is public. Hence, the default constructor gets the access specifier public.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>No argument Constructor</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider the following program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FileName:</strong> NoArgConstructor.java</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">public class NoArgConstructor\n {\n // no argument constructor\n NoArgConstructor()\n {\n System.out.println(\"Inside the no argument constructor. \");\n }\n public static void main(String argvs[])\n {\n     // creating an object of the class NoArgConstructor\n     // and invoking the no argument constructor\n     NoArgConstructor obj1 = new NoArgConstructor();\n }\n }</pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">Inside the no argument constructor.</pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Since, we have provided a no-argument constructor, the default constructor is absent. This no-argument constructor is getting called we create an object of the class <em>NoArgConstructor</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Parameterized Constructor</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A constructor with one or more parameters is called a parameterized constructor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FileName:</strong> Employee.java</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">public class Employee\n {\n String empName; // contains employee name\n int empId; // stores employee id\n // a parameterized constructor with two parameters\n Employee(String name, int id)\n {\n     // initializing the fields\n     empName = name;\n     empId = id;\n }\n // A method printing the information of an employee\n void printInfo()\n {\n     System.out.println(\"Employee name is: \" + empName + \", and his id is: \" + empId);\n }\n public static void main(String argvs[])\n {  \n     // creating two objects of the class Employee\n     // invoking paramterized constructor to initialize the  fields\n     Employee e1 = new Employee(\"Amit\", 12345);\n     Employee e2 = new Employee(\"Sumit\", 26789);\n     // printing the information of employee e1\n     e1.printInfo();\n     // printing the information of employee e2\n     e2.printInfo();\n }\n }</pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">Employee name is: Amit, and his id is: 12345\n Employee name is: Sumit, and his id is: 26789</pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The parameterized constructor is used to initialize fields of the class. In the code, the constructor has two parameters: one for the employee name and another for the employee id. Therefore, while creating the object of the class, we have to pass the mentioned parameters in the same order; otherwise, the Java compiler punishes with the compilation error. Note that the above code does not contain any zero-parameter constructor. Therefore, a statement like <em>new Employee();</em> must be avoided. Because the compiler tries to find <em>Employee()</em> in the code, which is absent. Since we have given a parameterized constructor, the existence of the default constructor is also ruled out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Constructor Chaining Program</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a constructor of a class invokes another constructor of the same class, called constructor chaining. Let’s understand the constructor chaining through the following Java program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FileName:</strong> Employee.java</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">public class Employee\n {\n // zero-parameter constructor\n Employee()\n {  \n     // calling the paramterized consturctor that takes\n     // one parameter\n     this(\"Amritesh\");\n     System.out.println(\"Inside the zero-parameter constructor.\");\n }\n // parameterized constructor that takes one argument\n Employee(String name)\n {\n     // calling another constructor that takes\n     // two parameters\n     this(name, 78901);\n     System.out.println(\"Inside the one-parameter constructor.\");\n }\n // parameterized constructor that takes two parameters\n Employee(String name, int id)\n {\n     // displaying the employee information\n     System.out.print(\"The name of the employee is \");\n     System.out.println(name + \", and his id is \" + id);\n     System.out.println(\"Inside the two-parameters constructor.\");\n }\n public static void main(String argvs[])\n {\n     // creating an object of the class Employee and\n     // calling no argument constructor\n     Employee e1 = new Employee();\n }\n }</pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">The name of the employee is Amritesh, and his id is 78901\n Inside the two-parameters constructor.\n Inside the one-parameter constructor.\n Inside the zero-parameter constructor.</pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When the statement new Employee() gets executed, the zero-parameter constructor is called. Inside the zero-parameter constructor, there is a statement <em>this(“Amristesh”);</em>, which does the construction chaining by calling the constructor having one string argument. Thus, the statements that are written after <em>this(“Amritesh”);</em> statement goes in the stack. &nbsp;Similarly, the single parameter constructor calls the constructor having two parameters. This time also, the statements after <em>this(name, 78901);</em> goes in the stack. The two parameters constructor executes the print statements written inside it. In the end, stack unwinding occurs, and whatever statements that are present in the stack get executed. The last two statements in the output are due to stack unwinding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Constructor Overloading Program</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Constructor overloading means having more than one constructor in a class that has different parameters. Here different parameters mean:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1) Number of parameters of the given constructors is different.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">public class ABC\n {\n                ABC()\n                {\n                  …\n                  …\n                }\n                ABC(int i)\n                {\n                  …\n                  …\n                }\n }</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Class ABC has two constructors: one has no parameter, while another has one parameter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2) Number of parameters is the same, but the order/ type of parameters is different.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">public class ABC\n {\n                ABC(int i, String str)\n                {\n                  …\n                  …\n                }\n                ABC(String str, int i)\n                {\n                  …\n                  …\n                }\n }</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Class ABC has two constructors. Each constructor accepts two parameters. In the first constructor, the first parameter is of type int, and the second parameter is of type string, whereas in the second constructor, the first parameter is of type string, whereas the second parameter is of type int. These two constructors can be assigned different responsibilities as per the requirement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Copy Constructor Program in Java</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A copy constructor is used to copying the values of one object to another object of the same class. Like C++, there is no copy constructor in Java. We have to create the copy constructor explicitly. The following program illustrates the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FileName:</strong> CopyConst.java</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">public class CopyConst\n {\n // class fields   \n int ab;\n String str;\n // parameterless constructor\n CopyConst()\n {\n     ab = 9;\n     str = \"ABC\";\n }\n // It is a copy constructor that copies the values of one object\n // to that object, which calls this copy constructor.\n // This constructor takes the class object as the argument, whose values\n // is going to be copied\n CopyConst(CopyConst ob)\n {\n     // copying the values of the object\n     ab = ob.ab;\n     str = ob.str;\n }\n // printing values of different fields of the objects of the class\n void printInfo()\n {\n     System.out.print(\" Value of the integer field is \" + ab + \" \");\n     System.out.println(\"Value of the string field is \" + str);   \n }\n // driver method\n public static void main(String argvs[])\n {\n     // creating an object, and calling the parameterless constructor\n     CopyConst obj1 = new CopyConst();\n     // creating another object, and calling the copy constructor\n     CopyConst obj2 = new CopyConst(obj1);\n     // displaying fields of the given object\n     obj1.printInfo();\n     obj2.printInfo();\n }\n }</pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">Value of the integer field is 9 Value of the string field is ABC\n Value of the integer field is 9 Value of the string field is ABC</pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The one-parameter constructor is doing the job of the copy constructor in the code. The rest of the code is very straightforward to comprehend.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/constructor-program-in-java/\">Constructor Program in Java</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com\">Tutorial And Example </a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Recurrence relation in DAA</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.tutorialandexample.com/recurrence-relation-in-daa/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[admin]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2021 06:58:08 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[DAA]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.tutorialandexample.com/?p=34432</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Recurrence relation in DAA The model that uses mathematical concepts to calculate the time complexity of an algorithm is known as the recurrence relational model.

Every recursive function consists of both recursive and base cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The section of the definition that does not contain T is called a base case of the recurrence relation, and the portion that contains T is called recursive or recursive relation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recurrence relations are very useful in calculating the running time complexities of recursive algorithms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation &#8211; Fn = F(n-1) + F(n-2)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>with initial conditions f1=1 and f2 = 1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Write the recurrence relation for the following method.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">void f(int n) {\n                    if (n > 0) {\n                cout &lt;&lt; n;\n     f(n-1);\n }\n                   }</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The base case is reached when n == 0. The method performs one comparison. Thus, the number of operations when n==0, T(0), is some constant a.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When n &gt; 0, the method performs two basic operations and then calls itself, using ONE recursive call, with a parameter n &#8211; 1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore the recurrence relation is:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T(0) = a where a is constant</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;T(n) = b + T(n-1) where b is constant, n &gt; 0</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solving recurrence relation</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following are the ways to solve a recurrence relation :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Recursion Tree method</li><li>Substitution method</li><li>Master method</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>SUBSTITUTION METHOD</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the substitution method, we make a guess for the solution, and then we use mathematical induction to prove the guessed answer is right or wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, Let us take the recurrence T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We guess the solution as T(n) = O(nLogn). Now we use induction</p>\n\n\n\n<p>to prove our guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to prove that T(n) &lt;= cnLogn. We can assume that it is true</p>\n\n\n\n<p>for values smaller than n.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;= 2cn/2Log(n/2) + n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp; cnLogn &#8211; cnLog2 + n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp; cnLogn &#8211; cn + n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;= cnLogn</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RECURRENCE TREE METHOD</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the recurrence tree method, a recurrence tree is drawn and calculates the time taken by every level of a tree. After analyzing each level, we sum up the work done at all levels. In order to draw a recurrence tree, start from the given recurrences and keep drawing till we find a pattern among all the levels. The pattern follows arithmetic or geometric series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, consider the recurrence relation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>T(n) = T(n/4) + T(n/2) + cn2</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cn2</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \\</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T(n/4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T(n/2)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we further break down the branches&nbsp; T(n/4) and T(n/2),</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get the following recursion tree:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cn2</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c(n2)/16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c(n2)/4</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \\</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp; T(n/16)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T(n/8)&nbsp; T(n/8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T(n/4)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Breaking down the tree further gives us the following result</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cn2</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c(n2)/16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c(n2)/4</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \\</p>\n\n\n\n<p>c(n2)/256&nbsp;&nbsp; c(n2)/64&nbsp; c(n2)/64&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c(n2)/16</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \\&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To know the value of T(n), we need to calculate the sum of tree nodes level by level. The following series &#8211; T(n)&nbsp; = c(n^2 + 5(n^2)/16 + 25(n^2)/256) + &#8230;.&nbsp; is obtained</p>\n\n\n\n<p>on analyzing the end levels of the tree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The above series is a geometric progression with a ratio of 5/16. We can sum the infinite series by calculating an upper bound.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get the sum as (n2)/(1 &#8211; 5/16), which is having a time complexity of O(n2).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>MASTER METHOD</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can get an immediate solution using the master method. The master method only works on the recurrence relations that can be transformed into the following relation:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n) Here,&nbsp; a &gt;= 1 and b &gt; 1</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are following three cases:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1.</strong> If f(n) = Θ(n<sup>c</sup>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>if c &lt; Log<sub>b</sub>a then T(n) = Θ(Log<sub>b</sub>a<sup>n</sup>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2.</strong> If f(n) = Θ(n<sup>c</sup>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>if c = Log<sub>b</sub>a then T(n) = Θ(n<sup>c</sup>Log n)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3.</strong>If f(n) = Θ(n<sup>c</sup>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>if c &gt; Log<sub>b</sub>a then T(n) = Θ(f(n))</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How does this work?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The master method is basically the derivation of the recurrence tree method. After drawing the recurrence tree of recurrence relation, T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n),</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;we can observe that the task done at root is f(n) and task done at all leaves is Θ(nc) where c is Log<sub>b</sub>a. And the height of the recurrence tree is Log<sub>b</sub>n.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Recurrence-relation-in-DAA.png\" alt=\"Recurrence relation in DAA\" class=\"wp-image-34436\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For example,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Merge sort &#8211; T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Θ(n).

This relation falls in <strong>2</strong> as c is 0 and Log<sub>b</sub>a &nbsp;is also 0.

It can also be called a hybrid algorithm of insertion and merge sort.  It is widely used in Java, Python, C, and C++ inbuilt sort algorithms. The idea behind this algorithm is to sort small chunks using insertion sort and then merge all the big chunks using the merge function of the <a href=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/merge-sort/\">merge sort algorithm</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Working</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this algorithm, the array is divided into small chunks. The chunks are known as <strong>RUN. </strong>Each RUN is taken and sorted using the insertion sort technique. After all the RUN are sorted, these are merged using the merge function. There may be a case where the size of the array can be less than RUN. In such a case, the array is sorted by the insertion sort technique. Usually, the RUN chunk varies from 32 to 64, depending on the size of the array. The merge function will only merge if the subarray chunk has the size of powers of 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advantage of using insertion sort is because insertion sort works fine for the array with a small size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time complexity &#8211;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Best case &#8211; Omega(n)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Average case &#8211; O(nlogn)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Worst case &#8211; O(nlogn)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>C++ code &#8211;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">#include&lt;bits/stdc++.h>\n using namespace std;\n const int RUN = 32;  // Initialising the RUN to get chunks\n void insertionSort(int arr[], int left, int right) // Implementing insertion sort for RUN size chunks\n {\n             for (int i = left + 1; i &lt;= right; i++)\n             {\n                         int t = arr[i];\n                         int j = i - 1;\n                         while (j >= left &amp;&amp;  t &lt; arr[j])\n                         {\n                                     arr[j+1] = arr[j--];\n                         }\n                         arr[j+1] = t;\n             }\n }\n void merge(int arr[], int l, int m, int r) // using the merge function, the sorted chunks of size 32 are merged into one\n {\n             int len1 = m - l + 1, len2 = r - m;\n             int left[len1], right[len2]; \n             for (int i = 0; i &lt; len1; i++)\n                         left[i] = arr[l + i]; // Filling left array\n             for (int i = 0; i &lt; len2; i++)\n                         right[i] = arr[m + 1 + i];  // Filling right array\n             int i = 0;\n             int j = 0;\n             int k = l;\n             while (i &lt; len1 &amp;&amp; j &lt; len2)  // Iterate into both arrays left and right\n             {\n                         if (left[i] &lt;= right[j]) // IF element in left is less then increment i by pushing into larger array\n                         {\n                                     arr[k] = left[i];\n                                     i++;\n                         }\n                         else\n                         {\n                                     arr[k] = right[j];  // Element in right array is greater increment j\n                                     j++;\n                         }\n                         k++;\n             }\n             while (i &lt; len1) // This loop copies remaining element in left array\n             {\n                         arr[k] = left[i];\n                         k++;\n                         i++;\n             }\n             while (j &lt; len2) // This loop copies remaining element in right array\n             {\n                         arr[k] = right[j];\n                         k++;\n                         j++;\n             }\n }\n void timSortAlgo(int arr[], int n)\n {\n             for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i+=RUN)           \n insertionSort(arr, i, min((i+31), (n-1)));  //Call insertionSort()\n             for (int s = RUN; s &lt; n; s = 2*s)     // Start merging from size RUN (or 32).

The name of an array contains an address which is the address of an element. In C++, an array name is considered as the <strong>address of the first element</strong>. For instance, if we have an array of size 20, i.e., it can hold 20 values, then the value will contain the first element&#8217;s address, i.e., <strong>array[0].</strong> Thus, it can be said that name of the array is a pointer that holds the memory address of the first element present in the array.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, an array of pointers is the array consisting of a variable of pointer types. This simply means that the pointer variable is addressing some other elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Syntax:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">int *pointer[N];</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Here,</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">*pointer = pointer array\n N = number of elements or size.</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Example:  </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">int *ptr[2];</pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: An array of the pointer can also be initialized by assigning the address of the variables like ptr[2] = &amp;a.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There can be various ways of implementing an array of pointers. We may see its application in the arrays and similar data structures like <strong>linked-lists, strings</strong>, etc. The array of pointers comes in handy while implementing these programming practices efficiently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To visualize how array of pointer work, let’s look at the below example:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">#include &lt;iostream> \n using namespace std; \n int main() \n { \n     int *pointer;   \n     int array[10];\n cout &lt;&lt; \"Please enter the array elements :\" &lt;&lt;endl; \n     for(int i=0;i&lt;10;i++) \n     { \n         cin>>array[i]; \n     } \n     pointer = array;  \n                       cout &lt;&lt; \"The value of *pointer :\" &lt;&lt;*pointer&lt;&lt;endl; \n                       cout &lt;&lt; \"The value of *array :\" &lt;&lt;*array&lt;&lt;endl; \n Return 0;\n } </pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cpp-Array-Pointer-1.png\" alt=\"C++ array of Pointers\" class=\"wp-image-34415\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above code, we implemented the array of pointers concerning an array that stores elements given by the user. As already discussed above, the array of pointers has the address of the first element of the array. We get the first element printed on the console. Therefore, we declared an integer pointer and integer type array, and we assigned the array to the pointer by equating pointer = array. It means that both have the same element, and the element is at the first index. The values for *<strong>pointer</strong> and *<strong>array</strong> will be the same since we have assigned them to be equal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us now look at how the arrays of pointers are used to implement strings using the example code given below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>String application of array pointers:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">#include&lt;bits/stdc++.h>\n using namespace std;\n const int Maximum = 4;\n int main ()\n {\n const char *pandavs[Maximum] = { \"Nakul\", \"Bhim\", \"Yudhishthir\",\n                          \"Sehdev\" };\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; Maximum; i++)\n {\n       cout &lt;&lt; \"Addresses of pandavs: [\" &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; \"] = \";\n       cout &lt;&lt; (pandavs + i) &lt;&lt; endl;\n }\n    return 0;\n }</pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CPP-Array-Pointer-2.png\" alt=\"C++ array of Pointers\" class=\"wp-image-34413\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above code, we have initialized the value of the array pointer to the maximum. Here, the maximum value can be anything, but to keep it simple and sober, we fixed the size to 4. We have used the const keyword to preserve the value of the maximum to 4. The const keyword is used so that the maximum value or, say, the array&#8217;s size doesn&#8217;t increase more than 4. The next step is to loop over the array to access all the values&#8217; addresses through the pointer array associated. The addresses of each value are then printed on the console using an array of pointers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Using array of pointers to print container values:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">#include&lt;bits/stdc++.h>\n using namespace std;\n const int Maximum = 4;\n int main () {\n    int  container[Maximum] = {10, 100, 200, 400};\n    int *pointer[Maximum];\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; Maximum; i++)\n  {\n       pointer[i] = &amp;container[i];\n   }\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; Maximum; i++) {\n       cout &lt;&lt; \"Value of container at position: [\" &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; \"] = \";\n       cout &lt;&lt; *pointer[i] &lt;&lt; endl;\n  }\n    return 0;\n }</pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cpp-Array-Pointer-3.png\" alt=\"C++ array of Pointers\" class=\"wp-image-34414\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above code, we have used a similar approach as we used in the string example. The value of maximum is constant (cannot be changed) and is kept 4. The only difference in this example is that we have used the container address which holds the integers. The next step is to iterate over the elements and by doing that we now know that each element in <strong>ptr</strong>, now holds a pointer to an <strong>int</strong> value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The output generated is the values at their respective indexes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us now look at some of the applications of array of pointers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Applications</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>The array of pointers comes in handy while making embedded systems.

This concept is a fair method for the developers and programmers to hint at the type of the object(s) being utilized while the compilation period itself ensuring that the type checkers are working correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong><em>Type Hinting</em></strong> also makes the Python Code pretty much robust and readable to other users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;This concept does not perform the actual type checking at the compilation period. Moreover, there will be no compilation error if the original object returned was not of a similar type as hinted. Thus, we utilize the external type checkers, like <strong>mypy</strong>, in order to recognize any type errors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-understanding-mypy\">Understanding mypy</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to use the typing module effectively, it becomes necessary to utilize an external type checker or linter to check for the static type matching. The <strong>mypy</strong> is one of the most widely used type checkers, and it is recommended to install before moving ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>mypy</strong> is the static type checker that can be installed using the following syntax in the command shell or terminal:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>$ pip install mypy</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Python-Typing-Module.png\" alt=\"Python Typing Module\" class=\"wp-image-34398\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the installation is complete, we can verify it by running <strong>mypy</strong> to any Python program file in order to check whether the types match. This procedure is somewhat similar to &#8216;compiling&#8217; Python code. This can be done by typing <strong>mypy</strong> followed with the python file name. The syntax can be seen below:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>$ mypy program_name.py</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the errors debugged, we can execute the program usually using the command shown below:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>$ Python program_name.py</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let&#8217;s see some of the Pros and Cons before understanding the typing module&#8217;s basic features.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-understanding-the-pros-and-cons-of-type-hints\">Understanding the Pros and Cons of Type Hints</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Some advantages of Type Hints are as follows:</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Type Hints supports the code documentation. Usually, if we need to document the common types of the arguments in functions, we would utilize the docstrings; however, since there is no such standard for docstrings (despite PEP 257, we cannot easily use them automatically checking).</li><li>Type hints also help in improving the Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) as well as linters. It becomes pretty more effortless for statically reasoning about the code using them. This, in turn, enables IDEs to offer better code completion and similar properties.</li><li>Type hints also allow the user to construct and sustain a cleaner architecture. The type hints writing acts enable the user to think about the types in the program. Despite the fact that Python&#8217;s dynamic nature is among its significant assets, being conscious about duck typing, multiple return types, or overloaded methods is a good thing.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Some Disadvantages of static type checking are as follows:</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Type hints consumer developer time and effort for addition. Even though it probably cuts the debugging time, we can find ourselves spending more time entering code.</li><li>Type hints perform better in modern Pythons as we know that Annotations were introduced in Python version 3.0, and we can also use the type comments in Python version 2.7. Moreover, a user will have a much better experience performing type checks after improvements like the postponed evaluation of type hints and variable annotations in Python version 3.6 or even version 3.7.</li><li>Type hints also introduce a minor penalty in start-up time. This can be observed especially in short scripts where, while using the typing module, the import time may be noteworthy.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of us might be thinking about whether we should use static type checking in the code or not. Well, it is not an all-or-nothing question. Fortunately, Python promotes the concept of <strong><em>gradual typing</em></strong>. The gradual typing implies that we can introduce types into the code gradually. The static type checker ignores the code without type hints. Hence, we can begin inserting the types to critical components and remain as long as it adds value to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving ahead, we will notice that adding types will not have any effect on the working program or the program&#8217;s users. Type checking is considered as the way to make the lives of developers better and much convenient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Some of the thumb rules on whether to insert types to the project are as follows:</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>If the user is just a beginner in Python, he or she can wait with the type hints until grabbing some more experience.</li><li>Type hints provide nominal value in short throw-away scripts.</li><li>Type hints, specifically ones published on <strong>PyPI</strong>, adds so much value to the libraries being used by others. Other codes utilizing the libraries require these type hints to be appropriately type-checked.</li><li>Type hints play a significant role in Bigger Projects by helping the users understand the types flow through the code and in projects where we cooperate with others.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In an excellent article by <strong>Bernát Gábor</strong>, he recommends using the type hints whenever the unit tests are worth writing. Indeed, the type hints have a similar role to tests in the codes and support developers in writing better codes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, we now have an idea on the working of type checking in Python and if we should employ it in the projects or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s go through a more complex type system of Python that includes the working of static type checkers (explicitly focusing on <strong>Mypy</strong>), type check code utilizing libraries without type hints, and use of annotations at runtime.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-understanding-annotations\">Understanding Annotations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Annotations</em></strong> have initially been introduced in Python version 3.0, without any particular purpose. Annotations were the method associating the arbitrary expressions to function arguments and return the values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the years passed, <strong><em>PEP 484</em></strong> was defined based on Jukka Lehtosalo&#8217;s work on his Ph.D. project called <strong>Mypy</strong>, telling how to insert type hints in the python code. The primary method in order to add type hints is utilizing Annotations. The type checking is becoming much more common, implying that annotations should mainly be reserved for type hints.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let&#8217;s understand the working of annotation in the context of type hints.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-function-annotations\">Function Annotations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We can simply annotate arguments as well as the return value for functions. This can be done in the following way:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>def&nbsp;function(arg:&nbsp;argtype,&nbsp;opt_arg:&nbsp;argtype&nbsp;=&nbsp;default)&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;returntype:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For arguments, the syntax is an <strong>argument: annotation</strong>, whereas the annotation for the return type is <strong>-&gt; annotation</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;The Annotation should be a valid Expression in Python.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us consider the following example, demonstration a simple addition of annotations to a function calculating the area of a circle:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">import math\n def area(rad: float) -> float:\n     return math.pi * rad * rad\n print(area(2.45))</pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">18.857409903172737</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above example, we have imported the math module and defined a simple function to calculate the circle area and print the area for radius: <strong>2.45</strong>, respectively. Now, let’s try inspecting the annotations. The annotations are stored in a special attribute called <strong>__annotations__</strong> on the function.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">import math\n def area(rad: float) -> float:\n     return math.pi * rad * rad\n print(area.__annotations__)</pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">{'rad': &lt;class 'float'&gt;, 'return': &lt;class 'float'&gt;}</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Occasionally, some of us might be confused by the role of <strong>Mypy</strong> interpreting the type hints. In such cases, <strong>reveal_type()</strong> and <strong>reveal_locals()</strong> are two special expression for <strong>Mypy</strong>. We can include these expressions in the code before executing <strong>Mypy</strong>, and <strong>Mypy</strong> will obediently report the inferred types.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us consider the example shown below demonstrating the working of <strong>Mypy</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\"># type_hints.py\n import math\n reveal_type(math.pi)\n rad = 3\n area = math.pi * rad * rad\n reveal_locals()</pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Output:</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">$ mypy type_hints.py \n type_hints.py:4: note: Revealed type is 'builtins.float'\n type_hints.py:8: note: Revealed local types are:\n type_hints.py:8: note:     area: builtins.float\n type_hints.py:8: note:     rad: builtins.int</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above example, we have imported the math module and used the <strong>reveal_type()</strong> expression for <strong>math.pi</strong>. We have then defined the radius, rad, and area of the circle. At last, we have used the <strong>reveal_locals()</strong> expression. As a result, when we saved the file and executed the program using <strong>Mypy</strong>, <strong>Mypy</strong> has accurately inferred the built-in <strong>math.pi</strong> types as well as the local variables like rad and area even without any annotations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;The reveal expressions are considered the user-friendly tool only to add types and debugging the type hints. If we try running the <strong><em>type_hints.py</em></strong> file as a Python script, it will get crashed with a <strong>NameError</strong> as the <strong>reveal_type()</strong> is not a function of the Python interpreter.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-variable-annotations\">Variable Annotations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As we can observe in the definition of <strong>area()</strong> in the previous section, it is possible to annotate the arguments and the return value only. We cannot insert any annotations within the body of the function. Usually, it is enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, type checker sometimes requires support to figure out the variable types also. <strong><em>Variable Annotations</em></strong> were defined in <strong>PEP 526</strong> and introduced in Python version 3.6. The syntax for Variable Annotations is similar to the annotations of<strong><em> Function Arguments</em></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following syntax demonstrates the same:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">pi: float = 3.142\n def area(rad: float) -> float:\n     return pi * rad * rad</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We have annotated the variable pi with the type hint, float.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Variable Annotations are reserved in the module level <strong>__annotations__</strong> dictionary:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us consider the following example:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">pi: float = 3.142\n def area(rad: float) -> float:\n     return pi * rad * rad\n print(area(2))\n print(__annotations__)</pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">12.568\n {'pi': &lt;class 'float'>}</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above program, we have defined a float type variable as <strong>pi</strong> with a value of <strong>3.142</strong>. We have then defined a function named <strong>area</strong> to calculate the size of the circle. We have also printed the area of the circle for radius = <strong>2</strong> and returned the variable annotations stored in the module level <strong>__annotations__</strong> dictionary. As a result, the program returned the area and type.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are allowed for the variable annotation without providing it a value. This inserts the annotation to the <strong>__annotations__</strong> dictionary, whereas the variable remains undefined. The following example demonstrates the same:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">nthing: str\n print(nthing)</pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">Traceback (most recent call last):\n   File \"D:\\Python\\type_hints.py\", line 3, in &lt;module>\n     print(nthing)\n NameError: name 'nthing' is not defined</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above example, we have annotated a variable, <strong>nthing</strong> as <strong>str</strong>. But it returns a <strong>NameError</strong> as <strong>the variable ‘</strong><strong>nthing</strong><strong>’ is not defined.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if we try using the <strong>__annotations__</strong> dictionary, it will return the type of the variable as illustrated below:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">nthing: str\n print(__annotations__)</pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">{'nthing': &lt;class 'str'&gt;}</pre>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-type-comments\">Type Comments</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the annotations were introduced in Python version 3 and have not been backported to Python version 2, this implies that we cannot use the annotations while writing a line of code supporting legacy Python.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In such cases, we can utilize the <strong><em>Type Comments</em></strong>. The <strong><em>Type Comments</em></strong> are specifically formatted comments utilized to insert type hints that are compatible with older code. In order to insert add type comments to a function, let us consider the following example:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">import math\n def area(rad):\n     # type: (float) -> float\n     return math.pi * rad * rad</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above example, we have created a simple function to print the area of a circle. However, we have added a comment saying <strong>type: (float) -&gt; float</strong>. This comment is a type comment, and thus, we can use such type comments in any Python version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the type checker handles these type comments directly, these types are not available in the <strong>__annotations__</strong><strong> </strong>dictionary.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">import math\n def area(rad):\n     # type: (float) -> float\n     return math.pi * rad * rad\n print(__annotations__)</pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">{}</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above code, we have tried printing the annotations of the variable, and as a result, it returns an empty dictionary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <strong>type comment</strong> always starts with the literal “<strong>type:</strong>” and be on the lines where the function is defined. Moreover, in order to annotate a function with more than one argument, we can write each type separated by a comma.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-type-aliases\">Type Aliases</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong><em>typing module</em></strong> offers the <strong>Type Aliases</strong>, which is defined by a type assigned to the alias.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us consider the following example:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">from typing import List\n # side is a list of float values\n Side = List[float]\n def perimeter(side: Side) -> Side:\n     return sum(i for i in side)\n quad = perimeter(side = [2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0])\n print(\"Perimeter:\", quad)</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Output:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">Perimeter: 20.0</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above snippet of code, we have imported the <strong>List</strong> from the <strong>typing</strong> module. We have then defined a variable <strong>side</strong> as an <strong>alias</strong>, which stands for a list of <strong><em>floating-point</em></strong> values. We have then defined a function named <strong>perimeter</strong> to print the sum of sides where we used the type hint at the alias.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us consider another example, which checks for every <strong><em>key-value pair</em></strong> in a dictionary and checks if they match the <strong>student_ID: student_name</strong> format.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">from typing import Dict\n # side is a list of float values\n studentDict = Dict[str, str]\n def validation(student: studentDict) -> bool:\n     for student_ID, student_Name in student.items():\n         if (not isinstance(student_ID, str)) or (not isinstance(student_Name, str)):\n             return False\n     return True\n print(validation({'10232': 'Michael Bing'}))\n print(validation({'12232': 'David Jones', 12345: 'Jenny Morgan'}))</pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Output from </strong><strong>mypy</strong><strong>:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">mypy type_hints.py\n type_hints.py:13: error: Dict entry 1 has incompatible type \"int\": \"str\"; expected \"str\": \"str\"\n Found 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above snippet of code, we have created a simple program to return the <strong><em>Boolean value</em></strong> for every <strong><em>key-value pair</em></strong> of the dictionary. As a result, <strong>mypy</strong> returns the static compile-time error since the <strong>student_ID</strong> on our second dictionary is an integer (<strong>12345</strong>). Thus, aliases are another method of enforcing correct type checking from <strong>mypy</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/python-typing-module/\">Python Typing Module</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com\">Tutorial And Example </a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Full form of HIV</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.tutorialandexample.com/full-form-of-hiv/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[admin]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 17 Feb 2021 07:37:17 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Full Form]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.tutorialandexample.com/?p=34384</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Full form of HIV: In the early 90s, the AIDS epidemic caused people to be scared of toilet seats and made sex seem frightful.

In the later stages of HIV infection, it damages your immune system and leads to&nbsp;Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome or AID. Hence it is also known as HIV/AIDS.</em></strong>”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HIV is a virus that attacks the cells that help fight infection in the body, and they impair the body&#8217;s ability to fight bacteria, viruses and fungal infections. In the last three decades alone, <strong>75 million people have been diagnosed as newly HIV positive</strong>, and many of these people don&#8217;t even know that they are infected. If HIV infection is left untreated, it usually takes approximately ten or fifteen years for the immune system to be so critically damaged that it can no longer defend itself. However, as per researchers, the pace at which HIV grows differs depending on age, body health and genes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HIV damages the special white blood cells (CD4 cells) and makes more copies of itself. If a considerable quantity of WBC&#8217;s is destroyed, the body is no longer capable of fighting against germs, infection and bacteria. In its advanced stage, HIV transforms into AIDS. AIDS is the stage when the human immune system is completely damaged. Well, we don&#8217;t have treatment for AIDS. We do have treatment available in prevention options for HIV. To ease in negative symptoms, Anti-retroviral therapy, better known as ART, is introduced to help people who are HIV positive with long and healthy lives and reduce their chances of transmitting HIV to another person. Another alternative is Pre-exposure prophylaxis (also known as Prep) is a medication to people who do not have HIV can take to lower their chances of developing HIV.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As per researchers, it is believed that both HIV-1 and HIV-2 HIV was first commenced in non-human species, and slowly with time, it dispersed and spread to humans. Although the disease had been around humans for generations, <strong>it was in the 1980s that it was diagnosed officially</strong>. Since then, this fatal infection has spread worldwide in no time leading to the AIDS epidemic, killing over 25 million people around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The overviews of HIV/AIDS infection are as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Specialty</td><td>Infectious disease,&nbsp;immunology</td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms</td><td>Early stage symptoms: Flu-like illnessLater stage symptoms:&nbsp;Large lymph nodes, fever, weight loss</td></tr><tr><td>Complications</td><td>Opportunistic infectionsTumors</td></tr><tr><td>Duration</td><td>Lifelong</td></tr><tr><td>Causes</td><td>Human immunodeficiency virus(HIV)</td></tr><tr><td>Risk factors</td><td>Unprotected sex,Possessing another sexually transmitted diseaseExperiencing needlestick crampNeedle sharingMedical procedures including unsterile cutting or piercing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Diagnostic method</td><td>Blood tests</td></tr><tr><td>Prevention</td><td>Safe and protected sexmale circumcisionneedle exchangepre-exposure prophylaxispost-exposure prophylaxis</td></tr><tr><td>Treatment</td><td>Antiretroviral therapy</td></tr><tr><td>Frequency</td><td>55.9 million to 100 million HIV worldwide cases (as per survey conducted in 2019)1.7 million new HIV cases (as per survey conducted in 2019)38 million living with HIV (2019)</td></tr><tr><td>Deaths</td><td>32.7 million total deaths (as per survey conducted in 2019)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-how-is-hiv-transmitted\">How is HIV transmitted?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>HIV is contracted in several different ways, but it is not a contagious disease and can’t be transmitted through urine, sweat or saliva. One would not get infected with this virus by simply touching, coughing or sneezing, hugging, kissing, or sharing towels or a toilet seat with someone who has the virus. The various ways of HIV transmission are given below:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>The most common way of HIV transmission is through <strong>unprotected sex</strong>.</li><li>Exchange of <strong>bodily fluids</strong>, namely semen and vaginal secretions.</li><li>Sharing of HIV <strong>infected blood</strong> products or the sharing of HIV infected needles.</li><li>A newborn can be infected with HIV <strong>through breastfeeding</strong> or even can be transmitted through <strong>pregnancy by birth</strong>.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-classification-of-hiv-stages\">Classification of HIV stages</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WHO (World Health Organization) first introduced a description for HIV/AIDS in 1986. The various stage HIV infections are as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Primary HIV infection:</strong>&nbsp;At this stage, the infected patient is mostly asymptomatic or suffers from acute retroviral syndrome.</li><li><strong>Stage I:</strong> The HIV-infected is either asymptomatic or associated with lymph node expansion.</li><li><strong>Stage II:</strong> The HIV infected may experience mild symptoms, including trivial&nbsp;mucocutaneous&nbsp;manifestations and chronic&nbsp;upper respiratory tract infections.</li><li><strong>Stage III:</strong> Usually, advanced HIV symptoms are witnessed at this stage, including&nbsp;recurrent&nbsp;diarrhea for more than a month, acute bacterial infections and even tuberculosis of the lung.</li><li><strong>Stage IV or AIDS:</strong> The last stage leads to AIDS or&nbsp;Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome. The infected person develops&nbsp;severe symptoms, including&nbsp;toxoplasmosis&nbsp;of the brain,&nbsp;candidiasis&nbsp;of the&nbsp;esophagus,&nbsp;lungs, trachea, bronchi,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Kaposi&#8217;s sarcoma (a type of cancer).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-signs-symptoms-of-hiv\">Signs &amp; Symptoms of HIV</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Full-form-of-HIV-2.png\" alt=\"Full form of HIV\" class=\"wp-image-34387\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Though no two people are the same, the vast majority of people will develop a symptom of severe flu-like illness after a prolonged period, mainly after two to six weeks after they come in contact with the virus. Some of the signs &amp; symptoms often encountered by HIV infected patients are given below:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Temperature</li><li>Chills</li><li>Severe Flu like illness</li><li>Skin rash</li><li>Headache</li><li>Diarrheal illness</li><li>Muscle pain and aches</li><li>Swollen lymph glands in the neck and under armpit</li><li>Joint pain</li><li>Sore throat</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-preventions-of-hiv\">Preventions of HIV</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Full-form-of-HIV-3.png\" alt=\"Full form of HIV\" class=\"wp-image-34388\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>ELISA or Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay is an HIV test that is conducted to detect HIV infection. So far, HIV/AIDS is fatal and cannot be cured, so the wisest solution is HIV prevention. The various precautious measures of HIV are as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>AIDS awareness amongst teenagers and adults is essential. Since it does not transmit by normal physical touch, the <strong>infected patient must not be isolated</strong> and should be handled with proper attention and care.&nbsp;</li><li>Always <strong>use protective sex barriers</strong> (male: external condoms and female internal condoms) during physical intercourse. It is the best method to prevent HIV infection and various other sexually transmitted infections.</li><li>While injecting drugs, always <strong>use a clean needle and syringe</strong>, and never share your personal items like razors, toothbrushes etc.</li><li>Suppose one got pregnant by having sexual intercourse with HIV infected. In that case, there is a possibility that the infection could pass to the baby’s body during pregnancy, birth or even through breastfeeding. But <strong>exercising HIV treatment rightly during the early stages of pregnancy and breastfeeding</strong> can implicitly eliminate the risk of HIV.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-who-is-at-risk-of-hiv-infection\">Who is at risk of HIV infection?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common question people ask who&#8217;s at risk of HIV infection and who should get tested?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most doctors advise that everybody gets tested, particularly those living in a relationship or starting a new relationship, or if someone thinks they had a high-risk encounter (by having an unprotected sexual encounter). However, certain groups are at higher risk of HIV infection. It includes people who share needles or are intravenous drug users or people who share needles for steroid use or sex workers.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/full-form-of-hiv/\">Full form of HIV</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com\">Tutorial And Example </a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Full Form of GPS</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.tutorialandexample.com/full-form-of-gps/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[admin]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 17 Feb 2021 07:08:07 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Full Form]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.tutorialandexample.com/?p=34374</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Full form of GPS GPS is changing the way we see the world.

Despite all its benefits, most of its users are not aware of its full form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The full form of the abbreviation GPS is <strong><em>Global Positioning System</em></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Full-form-of-GPS-1.png\" alt=\"Full Form of GPS\" class=\"wp-image-34377\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-what-is-gps\">What is GPS?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>“<strong><em>GPS or&nbsp;Global Positioning System&nbsp;is a navigational satellite system widely used to track an object&#8217;s ground location and provides the most suitable route from one location to another. Devices that use GPS technology works by receiving signals from special space satellites that orbit the earth.</em></strong>”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GPS is extensively utilized to locate and guide transportations, suggesting the best way from one point to another for transportation companies, airlines, car drivers and courier co-operations. GPS requires a minimum count of 24 space satellites deployed at an altitude of 19,300 miles above the Earth&#8217;s surface for its working and proper functioning. But the scientists usually use 30 satellites circling the planet to replace them in case anyone satellite fails. In today&#8217;s technology-driven era, all commercial electronic devices support GPS receivers, unlike mobile phones, smartwatches, cars, automobiles, and GIS devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GPS was first developed and introduced by U.S. in the 1960s to support the ships of the U.S. Navy in sailing the oceans more precisely. &nbsp;The users use GPS to discover the precise location, velocity, and time anytime anywhere (with an active internet network) in all weather conditions, worldwide. GPS is developed and controlled by the U.S. Department of Defense and was developed to help soldiers and assist military vehicles. Furthermore, after decades, it was made available to civilians if they own a GPS receiver.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Full-form-of-GPS-2.png\" alt=\"Full Form of GPS\" class=\"wp-image-34378\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The overviews of GPS are as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Origin County</td><td>United States</td></tr><tr><td>Operator(s)</td><td>US Space Force</td></tr><tr><td>Type</td><td>Military, civilian</td></tr><tr><td>Status</td><td>Operational</td></tr><tr><td>Coverage</td><td>Global</td></tr><tr><td>Accuracy</td><td>500–30&nbsp;cm (16–0.98&nbsp;ft)</td></tr><tr><td>Total satellites</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>Satellites in orbit</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>First launch date</td><td>February&nbsp;1978</td></tr><tr><td>Total Launches</td><td>72</td></tr><tr><td>Regime(s)</td><td>6x&nbsp;MEO&nbsp;planes</td></tr><tr><td>Orbital height</td><td>20,180&nbsp;km (12,540&nbsp;mi)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Technologies Used</strong></td><td>Global Nav.

In six orbital planes, approximately 24 space satellites are aligned.</li><li>The control segment:&nbsp;This segment is also known as stations installed on Earth to control and track the GPS space satellites.</li><li>User Segment:&nbsp;This GPS segment is used to facilitate the users to process the navigation signals collected from the GPS satellites to determine the location and time.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-working-principle-of-gps\">Working Principle of GPS</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>The GPS network contains a minimum of 24 space satellites present at an altitude of about 19,300 above the Earth’s surface. They orbit around the planet swiftly at a speed of around 11,200 kilometers per hour (once every twelve hours). All the 24 satellites are symmetrically aligned so that four satellites can be seen from Earth with a clear line of sight.</li><li>Each GPS satellite is outfitted with a set of computers, radio and atomic clock. With the information of its orbit and the clock, it uniformly emits the data of its position and time.</li><li>GPS satellites continually transmit signals that deliver two pieces of information, i.e., Current Time and satellite location above the Earth satellite. Commercial devices have inbuilt GPS receivers that utilize this information to perform a specific calculation called&nbsp;triangulation. The receiver compares the satellite time when the signal was sent with the time the signal was received. The variation in time is used to calculate the distance between the satellite and the receiver. The GPS receiver requires taking signals from 3 satellites to measure latitude and longitude, but if it receives a signal from four satellites, it can also help calculate altitude.&nbsp;</li><li>If the receiver is installed with a computer screen and a map, the location can also be displayed on the monitor.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-applications-of-gps\">Applications of GPS</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Full-form-of-GPS-3.png\" alt=\"Full Form of GPS\" class=\"wp-image-34379\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>GPS technology is used in commercial devices to render information with precision and accuracy that seemed impossible before. Researchers also use GPS to estimate the arctic ice stint variation, Earth&#8217;s tectonic plates, and volcanic eruption. The several applications of GPS are as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>GPS provides a precise position and time.</li><li>GPS is widely used to trace the movement of any person or object.</li><li>GPS promotes the conception of World maps.</li><li>GPS has bestowed the universe the concept of precise timing.</li><li>GPS is widely used to track the destination while traveling from one position to another.</li></ol>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/full-form-of-gps/\">Full Form of GPS</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com\">Tutorial And Example </a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Full Form of DRDO</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.tutorialandexample.com/full-form-of-drdo/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[admin]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2021 09:13:35 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Full Form]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.tutorialandexample.com/?p=34363</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Full Form of DRDO Do you know that the development and advancement of our Defence services rely on the shoulders of the DRDO organization.

In the above program, we have implemented the sizeof() operator to visualize how the sizeof() operator works in close integration with different data types.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">#include&lt;bits/stdc++.h>\n using namespace std; \n class Main\n     { \n     int x; \n     }; \n int main() \n { \n     Main y; \n         cout &lt;&lt; \"Size of Main class is : \"&lt;&lt;sizeof(y) &lt;&lt;endl; \n     return 0; \n } </pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sizeof-Operators-in-C-2.png\" alt=\"sizeof() Operators in CPP\" class=\"wp-image-34347\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above, we have implemented the use of the sizeof() operator using class. We have defined a class&nbsp;<strong>&#8216;Main,&#8217;</strong>&nbsp;with a data member &#8216;<strong>x</strong>&#8216; of integer type. We have defined another integer variable in the driver code, &#8216;b,&#8217; associate with class&nbsp;<strong>Main</strong>. Since we know that member &#8216;a&#8217; is an integer, so in the driver code, it should print as 4 if we use the sizeof() operator. Therefore, 4 is printed on the console as the size of an integer variable in the class &#8216;Main.&#8217;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, we can add more data members be it a <strong>char</strong> or a <strong>float</strong>. The sizeof() operator will return the total size of the variables or the data members assigned to some classes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lets us look how the sizeof() operator works for arrays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h>\n using namespace std; \n int main() \n { \n   int array[]={101,202,303,404,505,606}; \n   cout &lt;&lt; \"Size of the given array is : \"&lt;&lt; sizeof(array)&lt;&lt;endl; \n   return 0; \n }</pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sizeof-Operators-in-C-3.png\" alt=\"sizeof() Operators in CPP\" class=\"wp-image-34348\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above code, we have used the sizeof() operator to calculate the total size of the linear data type i.e., <strong>array</strong>. The array in the above code is initialized with the 6 different values. As we know that an integer is of 4 bytes, so the sizeof() operator returns the value of the integer on the console as 24.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example 4:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h>\n using namespace std; \n int main() \n { \n     int *pointer1=new int(11); \n         cout &lt;&lt; \"size of pointer 1 : \" &lt;&lt;sizeof(pointer1)&lt;&lt;endl;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n         cout &lt;&lt; \"size of *pointer 1 : \" &lt;&lt;sizeof(*pointer1)&lt;&lt;endl; \n    char *pointer2=new char('b'); \n         cout &lt;&lt;\"size of pointer 2 : \" &lt;&lt;sizeof(pointer2)&lt;&lt;endl; \n         cout &lt;&lt;\"size of *pointer 2 : \"&lt;&lt;sizeof(*pointer2)&lt;&lt;endl; \n    double *pointer3=new double(13.70); \n         cout &lt;&lt;\"size of pointer 3 : \" &lt;&lt;sizeof(pointer3)&lt;&lt;endl; \n         cout &lt;&lt;\"size of *pointer 3 : \"&lt;&lt;sizeof(*pointer3)&lt;&lt;endl; \n     return 0; \n } </pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sizeof-Operators-in-C-4.png\" alt=\"sizeof() Operators in CPP\" class=\"wp-image-34349\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above code, we have used the sizeof() operator to illustrate its working with the pointers. Therefore, we have constructed three-pointers, namely <strong>&#8216;pointer1&#8217;, &#8216;pointer2&#8217;, &#8216;pointer3&#8217;</strong> associated with three different data types <strong>int, char, </strong>and<strong> double(float).</strong> We have assigned values for these data types, respectively. Since we are very familiar with the size of different data types, the program returns their size concerning their original value and their associated pointer. The sizes are then displayed on the console as outputs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-advantages-of-using-sizeof-operator\">Advantages of using sizeof() operator</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The advantages are listed below:<strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Acts as a savior</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever we want to know the number of elements in an array or the type of fashion in which they are arranged, the sizeof() operator acts as a savior as it automatically does that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <strong>Helps in Memory allocation</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It adds a great advantage in dynamic programming as it allows the programmer to dynamically allocate the size of the block of memory. It helps in memory allocation with enough prior knowledge to allocate enough memory. The memory is allocated in a particular machine which is difficult to do with other operators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. <strong>Versatile and Flexible</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a versatile and flexible operator in C++, which helps in streamlining for the allocation of the memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Points to Remember:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>sizeof() operator is a compile-time unary operator that can be used to get the size of the operand.</li><li>The result of the size of the result returned by the sizeof() operator is an unsigned integer value which depends on the nature of the data-type.</li><li>Normally, the size of an object is the sum of its constituent data members. It is guaranteed that the sizeof() operator will never be smaller than that provided compiler keeps padding between data members to ensure alignment requirements of the platform.</li></ol>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/sizeof-operators-in-cpp/\">Sizeof() Operators in C++</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com\">Tutorial And Example </a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Function Pointer in C++</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.tutorialandexample.com/function-pointer-in-cpp/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[admin]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2021 06:06:43 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[C++]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.tutorialandexample.com/?p=34323</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Definition: A function pointer in C++ is the same as a usual pointer which is used to point some variables.

Function pointers are used to point functions or say <strong>store the address</strong> of a function. A function pointer can be used to pass the pointer as a parameter for the other functions and we can call them easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Function Address:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We already know that a computer understands only the binary language. In high-level programming languages like C++, a compiler is a program that converts the code into machine understandable and stores it in the executable file. The copy of this executable file is stored in the <strong>RAM</strong>. When the CPU starts the execution from the main() method, it copies the file from RAM and not the original file.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This process of execution involves occupying some space in the memory. The source code may be a generic one or functional. All these executable source codes occupy space that has an address in RAM. The function pointer has the RAM address of the first instruction of a function.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Syntax:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">int (*foo) (int);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>OR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">int (*FuncPtr) (int,int);</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The above syntax is a function declaration. We know that C++ is a type-safe language and the functions are not simple as defining variables. Therefore, function pointers possess a parameter list and return type. In the above syntax, we have defined the return type and the name of the pointer. The function pointer uses the <strong>* </strong>operator. There are two integers which are the parameters that are passed with them. In simple words, the function pointer <strong>FuncPtr</strong> can point to any function which has two integer type parameters and a return value of integer type.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Storing function address:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The function pointer stores the address of the function. We do not need to call the function in the driver code, we just need to mention the function name so that we can easily get the address of the function.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us now look at some of the ways through which function pointer stores addresses of functions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">#include&lt;bits/stdc++.h>\n using namespace std;\n int fool()\n {\n     return 5;\n }\n int main()\n {\n     cout &lt;&lt; fool &lt;&lt; '\\n';\n     return 0;\n }</pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Function-Pointer-in-C-1.png\" alt=\"Function Pointer in C++\" class=\"wp-image-34331\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above code, we have declared a function named <strong>fool()</strong> which returns an integer value 5. To understand this, we need to be clear with the compilers. We have 1 as output in the online GCC compiler while in the other compiler the output may look like &#8211; <strong>0xfd23d421</strong>.This is nothing but an unreadable memory address that is accessed using a function pointer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Indirect function calling</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\">#include&lt;bits/stdc++.h>\n using namespace std; \n int multiply(int x , int y) \n { \n     return x*y; \n } \n int main() \n { \n                 int (*funcptr)(int,int); \n                 funcptr=multiply;\n                 int total=funcptr(4,7); \n                 cout &lt;&lt; \"Value of multiplication is :\" &lt;&lt;total&lt;&lt;endl;\n   return 0; \n } </pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Function-Pointer-in-C-2.png\" alt=\"Function Pointer in C++\" class=\"wp-image-34332\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above code, we have used a function pointer to point the function <strong>multiply</strong> which takes two integer parameters x and y, and returns the multiplication. We have defined a function pointer <strong>funcptr</strong> that points to the function &#8216;multiply&#8217;. The function multiply is passed to the funcptr. This is called an <strong>indirect function call.</strong> Another variable <strong>&#8216;total&#8217;</strong> stores the value of multiplication which is indirectly passed with both the integer parameters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result is then printed on the console.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: There can be cases where the function is passed with more or fewer arguments. In such cases, the compiler may return &#8216;too few&#8217; or &#8216;too many argument&#8217; error.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> Passing function pointer as a parameter.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag\"> #include&lt;bits/stdc++.h>\n using namespace std; \n void function1() \n { \n     cout&lt;&lt;\"Function1 is being called!\"; \n } \n void function2(void (*funcptr)()) \n { \n     funcptr(); \n } \n int main() \n { \n   function2(function1); \n   return 0; \n <strong>}</strong></pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Function-Pointer-in-C-3.png\" alt=\"Function Pointer in C++\" class=\"wp-image-34333\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above code, we have defined two functions named <strong>&#8216;function1&#8217; </strong>and<strong> &#8216;function2&#8217;</strong>. The task is to use function is to pass function pointer as a parameter. To do this, we defined a function pointer &#8216;funcptr&#8217; in function2 as a parameter and the pointer is called itself inside the function. When function1 is passed as an argument in function2 then the function pointer &#8216;funcptr&#8217; points to function1 and executes the code inside it. By this action, function1 is called as a result and is then displayed on the console.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: The main() method calls the function2() in which the address of the function1 is passed. The function2 is calling function1 indirectly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Points to Remember:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>The main task of the function pointer is to allow us to pass a function to a variable and store them for later use.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A function pointer is used to point to any function with the same signature.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Unlike other pointers, the function pointer does not de-allocate memory.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Unlike other pointers, the function pointer points to code, not data.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com/function-pointer-in-cpp/\">Function Pointer in C++</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tutorialandexample.com\">Tutorial And Example </a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>\n"},"redirectURL":"","headersSize":-1,"bodySize":187511},"cache":{},"timings":{"blocked":-1,"dns":-1,"connect":-1,"ssl":-1,"send":2.016200006008148,"wait":668.2303999960423,"receive":786.7151999920607}},{"pageref":"Embarcadero","startedDateTime":"2021-02-23T16:57:26.287-07:00","time":1042.6437999904156,"request":{"method":"GET","url":"https://fueled.com/feed/","httpVersion":"HTTP/1.1","cookies":[],"headers":[{"name":"connection","value":"Keep-Alive"},{"name":"cookie","value":"__cfruid=c380f2086cca5447b9e1d48d14751967180543aa-1614124635; uid=lo_1fc4bf97e9f9; __cfduid=d47d2779bf39e49c3c7af6c553cc1dede1614124629"},{"name":"user-agent","value":"Embarcadero URI Client/1.0"},{"name":"host","value":"fueled.com"}],"queryString":[],"headersSize":-1,"bodySize":0},"response":{"status":200,"statusText":"OK","httpVersion":"HTTP/1.1","cookies":[],"headers":[{"name":"server","value":"nginx/1.16.1"},{"name":"date","value":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 23:57:25 GMT"},{"name":"content-type","value":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8"},{"name":"transfer-encoding","value":"chunked"},{"name":"connection","value":"keep-alive"},{"name":"x-powered-by","value":"PHP/7.0.28-0ubuntu0.16.04.1"},{"name":"set-cookie","value":"PHPSESSID=82lhie9m51hmuf2j3ont7stgg1; path=/,country_code=US"},{"name":"expires","value":"Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT"},{"name":"cache-control","value":"no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate"},{"name":"pragma","value":"no-cache"},{"name":"last-modified","value":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 05:37:40 GMT"},{"name":"etag","value":"\"600dcedbca8f09a80e5167bc4ce9ac7f\""},{"name":"x-robots-tag","value":"noindex, follow"},{"name":"link","value":"<https://fueled.com/wp-json/>; rel=\"https://api.w.org/\""}],"content":{"mimeType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","size":76052,"text":"<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?><rss version=\"2.0\"\n\txmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"\n\txmlns:wfw=\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\"\n\txmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\n\txmlns:atom=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"\n\txmlns:sy=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/\"\n\txmlns:slash=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\"\n\t>\n\n<channel>\n\t<title>Fueled</title>\n\t<atom:link href=\"https://fueled.com/feed/\" rel=\"self\" type=\"application/rss+xml\" />\n\t<link>https://fueled.com</link>\n\t<description>The Fueled team is united by an unwavering passion for quality.

Mueller makes it clear up front that version 5 will be free for existing customers but also introduces a free tier for new users to try the app in a limited capacity before subscribing to the app.\r\n<div class=\"content-block--bg\">\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-28397\" src=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CARROT-App-Showcase-02.png\" alt=\"carrot weather app screens\" width=\"1440\" height=\"814\" srcset=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CARROT-App-Showcase-02.png 1440w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CARROT-App-Showcase-02-300x170.png 300w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CARROT-App-Showcase-02-768x434.png 768w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CARROT-App-Showcase-02-1024x579.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" />\r\n\r\nWith this update comes a whole new look. It is still the cartoony and wonderfully animated app we’ve loved but it looks cleaner and more in line with the iOS and macOS ecosystems. That new design is accompanied by Interface Maker. This is a new way to completely customize the layout of the of the app to your liking. Change the styles of each component, change the positions, and add additional sections. Mueller is promising “millions” of additional configuration possibilities in future updates. This could be overwhelming but Carrot presents only a few configurations at a time, introducing a few at a time for the first few days after your update. You can skip this, but it is a novel way to introduce the functionality without scaring users away.\r\n\r\nOnce you have a preset you love — or a few you love — you can switch through them any time you like. If you struggle coming up with your own designs, Carrot has a few already created that you can rely on.\r\n\r\nA big component of those interfaces are cards. Cards are a quick way to display information that would otherwise be buried within the app. Pollen count, moon phase, pressure, are all of the more than a dozen cards that are shown in the new interface. These cards are AI-driven and will populate the most relevant cards when necessary.\r\n\r\nThere’s a ton of other goodness baked-in too. New quick actions for common tasks like switching data sources or location, a pile of new achievements, oodles of other app icons, and over 2,000 additional lines of dialogue. This truly is a massive update.\r\n\r\nWhen Carrot Weather first hit the App Store, I never knew how much a developer could do with such a single-minded app. But Brian Mueller has spent years developing a full featured, well- designed, hilarious, great-looking weather app. Carrot Weather is certainly on its way of taking over the world.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class=\"align--center p--large\">But enough about other people&#8217;s apps.</p>\r\n<p class=\"align--center\"><a class=\"btn link--btn link--btn-accent\" href=\"https://fueled.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LET&#8217;S TALK ABOUT YOURS</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fueled.com/blog/carrot-weather/\">Carrot Weather Continues To Give Weather a Makeover</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fueled.com\">Fueled</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://fueled.com/blog/carrot-weather/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Agree Takes the Pressure Off Group Decisions</title>\n\t\t<link>https://fueled.com/blog/agree/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://fueled.com/blog/agree/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 04 Feb 2021 14:45:06 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Andrew O'Hara]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[App of the Week]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iphone]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[smartphone]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[apple]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Android]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iOS]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iphone 12]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[agree]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[agree app]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[social app]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://fueled.com/?p=28389</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Can we all agree on something really quick?

No? We can’t? Well, maybe we should try out Agree. This simple app aids decision making for groups by allowing the creation of a seemingly endless list of polls. Poll your friends for dinner, what movie to see, or which episode of The Simpsons is the best.\r\n\r\nUpon launch, you see all the ongoing polls as well as how many options each has, if it is shared with others, and when the poll will close. If a poll has already finished, the winning selection is also displayed in this home view.\r\n\r\nIf you jump into one of existing polls you can place your vote with a quick right swipe. The app gives you the option to denote when you replied or leave the timestamp off. When you want to share with someone, you can just message them and only requires users to have an iCloud account to participate. That means you don’t have to have everyone else login with Facebook, Twitter, or Google making it all the more safer.\r\n<div class=\"content-block--bg\">\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/agree/id1547610115\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-28395\" src=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Agree-App-Showcase-02.png\" alt=\"agree app screens\" width=\"1440\" height=\"814\" srcset=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Agree-App-Showcase-02.png 1440w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Agree-App-Showcase-02-300x170.png 300w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Agree-App-Showcase-02-768x434.png 768w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Agree-App-Showcase-02-1024x579.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" /></a>As a poll comes to an end, a notification will show up letting you know which option was chosen at the winner. At one point I lived in a house with nine other people and I can’t think of a better way to make group decisions for what we should order for dinner, who won a competition, what movie to see, and oh so many others.\r\n\r\nWhile I’m singing Agree’s praises, I have to mention the strict adherence to both iOS and accessibility guidelines. Agree fully supports VoiceOver for vision-impaired users. And by following the iOS guidelines it scales to natively fill any-sized iPhone, Mac or iPad you have, adjusts text based on system setting, supports keyboard shortcuts, collects no data from users, supports Family Sharing, is a universal purchase, and more. There are Home Screen quick actions via the contextual menu and more than 40 app icons you can choose between. Talk about being an upstanding Apple ecosystem citizen.\r\n\r\nAgree is a free app which is even better. For $3 you can nab Agree+ which unlocks those alternate icons, themes for the app, and unlimited options in each poll.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class=\"align--center p--large\">But enough about other people&#8217;s apps.</p>\r\n<p class=\"align--center\"><a class=\"btn link--btn link--btn-accent\" href=\"https://fueled.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LET&#8217;S TALK ABOUT YOURS</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fueled.com/blog/agree/\">Agree Takes the Pressure Off Group Decisions</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fueled.com\">Fueled</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://fueled.com/blog/agree/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The 8 Best Apps For Dog Lovers in 2021</title>\n\t\t<link>https://fueled.com/blog/dog-lovers-apps/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://fueled.com/blog/dog-lovers-apps/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 28 Jan 2021 11:00:30 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Andrew O'Hara]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[iOS App Development]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Featured]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[apps]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iphone]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[google]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[smartphone]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[apple]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Android]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iOS]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[app]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iphone 12]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iphone 12 pro]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[dog app]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[apps for dog lovers]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[chewy]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[tiktok]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://fueled.com/?p=24681</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Jump Down: 1.

I know I speak for a good deal of our team when I say we love dogs almost as much as we love developing apps — it’s why we’ve adopted a <a href=\"http://www.fox5ny.com/news/benefits-of-dogs-in-the-workplace\">dog-friendly office policy</a>. At Fueled, there’s always at least pup around for much-needed loves and snuggles. So for National Dog Day, we decided to put <a href=\"https://fueled.com/iphone-app-design/\">our expertise</a> to the test and provide an up-to-date list of the best apps for dog lovers. \r\n\r\nThese apps will please dog lovers of all kinds, from owners of a family of pups to folks looking to adopt, to just regular dog enthusiasts. Each of these apps is extremely highly rated on the App Store and Google Play Store and all of them are a treat for dogs, pet owners, and dog lovers.<a name=\"jump1\"></a>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-28375\" src=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Chewy-App-Showcase.png\" alt=\"chewy app\" width=\"1512\" height=\"880\" srcset=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Chewy-App-Showcase.png 1512w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Chewy-App-Showcase-300x175.png 300w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Chewy-App-Showcase-768x447.png 768w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Chewy-App-Showcase-1024x596.png 1024w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Chewy-App-Showcase-450x263.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1512px) 100vw, 1512px\" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3 id=\"chewy\"><a href=\"#chewy\" class=\"heading-link\"><i class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-link\"></i></a>Chewy</h3>\r\n<a name=\"jump1\"></a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.chewy.com/ci/lp/resp/chewy-app/chewy-app.html\">Chewy</a> has easily helped my family save money as well as come in clutch when we needed pet supplies time and time again. The app has a huge variety of toys, foods, medicines, and more that will almost certainly meet your needs at a fair price. It’s no surprise that this app has become a mainstay on all pet owner’s devices. It also happens to be very nicely designed and laid out with clear categories, your autoship orders, and your favorite items.\r\n\r\nThe auto shipped deliveries can have your food at your door on a regular basis taking out the need to head to the store whenever you run low. Subscribing also nets you a solid discount. Convenience and savings? Literally, sign me up!\r\n\r\nOwning a pet can be expensive and time-consuming. Anything that can reliably help with those deserves a space on my home screen. And Chewy has been there for some time now.\r\n<h3 id=\"\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"heading-link\"><i class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-link\"></i></a><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-28380\" src=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Puppr-App-Showcase.png\" alt=\"puppr app\" width=\"1512\" height=\"880\" srcset=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Puppr-App-Showcase.png 1512w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Puppr-App-Showcase-300x175.png 300w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Puppr-App-Showcase-768x447.png 768w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Puppr-App-Showcase-1024x596.png 1024w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Puppr-App-Showcase-450x263.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1512px) 100vw, 1512px\" /></h3>\r\n<h3 id=\"puppr\"><a href=\"#puppr\" class=\"heading-link\"><i class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-link\"></i></a>PUPPR</h3>\r\n<a name=\"jump2\"></a>\r\nThis is probably not the first time you’ve seen or heard of <a href=\"https://www.puppr.app/\">Puppr</a>. This app has been around for years yet has continued to get better. The devs have continued to invest in the app by adding new features with update after update. Apple even featured it as an Editor’s Choice. The app is a fantastic go-to option for training your dog. Puppr has more than 70 lessons available to you put together by professional trainers. Each lesson is comprised of clear written instructions as well as photos and videos for you to see the lesson in action. Struggling? Jump into the app to chat with a live trainer to get their insight on what you can do. Your dog has its own profile in the app, where you can track your progress through all the lessons. They’ve gamified training your pup by awarding accolades in the form of digital badges for finished classes.\r\n\r\nThe app also features an in-app digital clicker for clicker training and a curated shop of training treats, training equipment, crates, and other necessities signed-off on by respected trainers. This app has so much a new — or existing — dog owner needs and it only gets better over time and more and more classes, items, and features are added.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-28379\" src=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Petcube-App-Showcase.png\" alt=\"petcub app\" width=\"1512\" height=\"880\" srcset=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Petcube-App-Showcase.png 1512w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Petcube-App-Showcase-300x175.png 300w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Petcube-App-Showcase-768x447.png 768w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Petcube-App-Showcase-1024x596.png 1024w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Petcube-App-Showcase-450x263.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1512px) 100vw, 1512px\" />\r\n<h3 id=\"petcube\"><a href=\"#petcube\" class=\"heading-link\"><i class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-link\"></i></a>Petcube</h3>\r\n<a name=\"jump3\"></a>\r\nGiving treats to my dogs is almost as rewarding for me as it is for them. Almost, I’m pretty sure they still enjoy it more than I do. But I can’t help but love how happy they are when I give them treats! And leaving for long bouts does make me miss their slobbery, furry faces. Enter — <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/petcube/id720151500\">Petcube</a>.\r\n\r\nPetcube designs physical cameras and treat dispensers for you to stay in touch with your dog (or perhaps cat) while you’re away. The most basic Petcube camera is designed specifically for monitoring your pets while others include treat dispensers that you can trigger from anywhere. Check in with your dog, talk to them through the microphone and speaker built into the Petcube device, and — if they sit of course — reward them with a treat. It is fun for you, allows you to connect with them while you aren’t there, and they of course get a treat out of it!\r\n\r\nThe accompanying app is easy to use and the best way I’ve found to see my dogs when my wife and I can’t be there.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-28377\" src=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GoodPup-App-Showcase.png\" alt=\"goodpup\" width=\"1512\" height=\"880\" srcset=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GoodPup-App-Showcase.png 1512w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GoodPup-App-Showcase-300x175.png 300w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GoodPup-App-Showcase-768x447.png 768w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GoodPup-App-Showcase-1024x596.png 1024w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GoodPup-App-Showcase-450x263.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1512px) 100vw, 1512px\" />\r\nGoodPup</h3>\r\n<a name=\"jump4\"></a>\r\nWho’s a good pup!

Because you went and downloaded <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/goodpup-dog-training-at-home/id1330109521\">GoodPup</a>. This wonderfully-designed app lets you get one-on-one lessons with certified, reviewed, and vetted trainers to get your dog behaving as best it can.\r\n\r\nLessons are conducted in real time via video chat so the trainer can see exactly how you’re teaching the dog, ensuring you’re doing everything right. You choose your trainer based on their picture, bio, ratings, certifications, and specialties.\r\n\r\nIn between video sessions you can chat with your trainer, getting quick answers to common questions. The app allows for flexible scheduling so you can train your pup when it is convenient for you. With the global pandemic, training remotely is even more beneficial as you don’t have to travel out or invite someone into your home. Training your dog is a necessity and GoodPup can help make sure you’re doing it and doing it right. Don’t let your dog down!\r\n<h3><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-28382\" src=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Whistle-App-Showcase.png\" alt=\"whistle \" width=\"1512\" height=\"880\" srcset=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Whistle-App-Showcase.png 1512w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Whistle-App-Showcase-300x175.png 300w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Whistle-App-Showcase-768x447.png 768w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Whistle-App-Showcase-1024x596.png 1024w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Whistle-App-Showcase-450x263.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1512px) 100vw, 1512px\" />\r\nWhistle</h3>\r\n<a name=\"jump5\"></a>\r\nNot going to lie — I very much worry about my dogs escaping my fenced-in back yard. I also worry about my dogs becoming overweight and getting one of many ailments that can befall them because of that. I want to be a good dog-dad and these thoughts go through my mind fairly often. I have a camera in the backyard just to be sure I can keep an eye on them! But if they ever would escape, I’d be out of luck tracking them down as they’d surely book it through\r\nthe open fields.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.whistle.com/\">Whistle</a> is a combination activity tracker for dogs as well as a locator should they ever run free. This is huge for city-dwelling dog owners where they can run through streets atop streets as well as those in the country where there are no bounds. Even well-trained dogs can become distracted and meander away.\r\n\r\nThe Whistle tag goes on their collar and will automatically alert you should your dog leave its safe zone. That can be your yard or even the local dog park. Then you can rest easy that your dog is where it should be. If it does flee, you get the alert and can follow them so you can bring them back to their home — safe and sound.\r\n\r\nSince the tracker is on their collar, it can also track their movement throughout the day. See how much your canine friend moves and set activity goals based on your dog’s age, breed, and weight. It gives a bit more peace of mind that you aren’t overfeeding and your dog is staying sufficiently active. See where your dog travels, unlock badges for activity achievements, and keep your dog motivated with gentle nudges if your dog is too sedentary. Turn on a light on your dog’s tag if you can’t find them in the dark and keep track of your pet’s health by seeing how much they are scratching or licking themselves.\r\n\r\nThe app is clean, light, and a great example of a well-designed iOS app. I’ve used Whistle for the last year and easily recommend it for any dog owner who wants to know more about their four-legged friend.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-28381\" src=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TikTok-App-Showcase.png\" alt=\"tiktok app\" width=\"1512\" height=\"880\" srcset=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TikTok-App-Showcase.png 1512w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TikTok-App-Showcase-300x175.png 300w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TikTok-App-Showcase-768x447.png 768w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TikTok-App-Showcase-1024x596.png 1024w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TikTok-App-Showcase-450x263.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1512px) 100vw, 1512px\" />\r\n<h3 id=\"tiktok\"><a href=\"#tiktok\" class=\"heading-link\"><i class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-link\"></i></a>TikTok</h3>\r\n<a name=\"jump6\"></a>\r\nIf you’ve got a fluffy friend of any variety — be it purring kit-cat, a slobbery ball-chasing fluffer, or perhaps a bun-bun with a boop-able nose — you’ve got to share the cuteness with the world. Of course old standbys such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are perfect for sharing your adorable pet but the new kid on the block is <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/en\">TikTok</a>.\r\n\r\nTikTok is a social media app for sharing short video clips with the world. Show off your dogs new trick, brag about your lake-side nap with your dog, or show them acting derpy around the home.\r\n\r\nThe app is easy to use, simple to upload your own vids, and is full of special effects to overlay text and animations to make your videos stand out. Not to mention how addicting it is to sit and swipe away looking at everyone else’s canine friends.\r\n\r\nI love that it focuses on video rather than photos as none of the other platforms are really optimized for video. Insta, Facebook, Twitter all can share videos, but were created with photos and text in mind. Best of all, like most other social media, it is free to download and use.\r\n<h3><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-28378\" src=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Pet-First-Aid-App-Showcase.png\" alt=\"pet first aid app\" width=\"1512\" height=\"880\" srcset=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Pet-First-Aid-App-Showcase.png 1512w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Pet-First-Aid-App-Showcase-300x175.png 300w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Pet-First-Aid-App-Showcase-768x447.png 768w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Pet-First-Aid-App-Showcase-1024x596.png 1024w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Pet-First-Aid-App-Showcase-450x263.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1512px) 100vw, 1512px\" />\r\nPet First Aid</h3>\r\n<a name=\"jump7\"></a>\r\nIdeally, you should never need to know how to carry out first aid on your dog, But in the event an emergency does arise, you’ll be happy to know you have the American Red Cross <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pet-first-aid/id780415389\">Pet First Aid app</a> already installed.\r\n\r\nWe’ve long recommended the American Red Cross First Aid app to everyone as a necessity and for pet owners it is equally as necessary. The pet version of the app is designed just like its human counterpart with clean layouts and clear photos and videos for all the common ailments and accidents that could befall your pet. There is proactive material as well, walking you through preventative care and maintaining yourpup’s well-being.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency, not only are there instructions on what to do, there are\r\nemergency tools to guide you to the nearest vet hospital. Again, I hope you never have to use it, but it doesn’t hurt to have the American Red Cross Pet First Aid app downloaded just in case.\r\n<h3><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-28376\" src=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Dog-Scanner-App-Showcase.png\" alt=\"dogscanner\" width=\"1512\" height=\"880\" srcset=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Dog-Scanner-App-Showcase.png 1512w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Dog-Scanner-App-Showcase-300x175.png 300w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Dog-Scanner-App-Showcase-768x447.png 768w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Dog-Scanner-App-Showcase-1024x596.png 1024w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Dog-Scanner-App-Showcase-450x263.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1512px) 100vw, 1512px\" />\r\nDog Scanner</h3>\r\n<a name=\"jump8\"></a>\r\nThis app is bot useful as well as just entertaining. <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dog-scanner/id1447489158\">Dog Scanner</a> allows you to scan a dog using your iPhone’s camera (or an uploaded photo) and will use machine learning and artificial intelligence to determine what breed the dog is — even mixes, The app houses more than 350 FCI breeds as well as additional ones that are common even if\r\nnot officially recognized.

Once you’re done, share your photo in the new social feed with other dog lovers.\r\n\r\nIf you see a lot of dogs, the app can be educational by rewarding you for scanning more and more dogs. Are you a dog expert? Badges and achievements will let you know.\r\nThe best part is if you have no dog around and no photo handy, point the camera app at your friend to see what dog breed he or she looks like. “Ah yes, that is a human who appears 23% like a greyhound.”\r\n\r\nOnce scanned the app will provide background on the breed, showing you a picture, giving you a lot of information on how the breed came to be, and how often it is recognized by the app.\r\n\r\nSo whether you are looking to learn more about your own pup, a stray your wife brought home (true story&#8230;), or just looking to teach your youngster about the different breeds of dog out there, Dog Scanner is a fun app<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fueled.com/blog/dog-lovers-apps/\">The 8 Best Apps For Dog Lovers in 2021</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fueled.com\">Fueled</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://fueled.com/blog/dog-lovers-apps/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>2020 Fortune 1000 Companies</title>\n\t\t<link>https://fueled.com/blog/2020-fortune-1000-companies/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://fueled.com/blog/2020-fortune-1000-companies/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 27 Jan 2021 17:55:03 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Max Falb]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[treasure chest]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[fortune 1000]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[fortune 500]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[2020 companies]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[2020 fortune 500]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[2020 fortune 1000]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[fortune 1000 companies]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://fueled.com/?p=28345</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>We were trying to find a list of  the 2020 Fortune 1000 Companies and had difficult finding a decent list to use, so we decided to make one ourselves.

Smith, At the time he was an assistant managing editor for Fortune,  first created the list in 1955. The first list only included companies hat were in the manufacturing, mining, and energy sectors. This left out some major companies because of that specification. The first to top the Fortune 500 list was General Motors with annual <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fortune500.asp\">revenues of $9.8 billion.</a> In 1995 however, they changed the requirements for the list and allowed companies in the service sector to also be apart of the list.  This allowed Walmart to rank fourth that year and AT&amp;T who ranked fifth.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fueled.com/blog/2020-fortune-1000-companies/\">2020 Fortune 1000 Companies</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fueled.com\">Fueled</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://fueled.com/blog/2020-fortune-1000-companies/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Denim is Simple with a Purpose</title>\n\t\t<link>https://fueled.com/blog/denim/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://fueled.com/blog/denim/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 27 Jan 2021 14:45:08 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Andrew O'Hara]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[App of the Week]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[apps]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iphone]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[google]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[smartphone]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[apple]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Macbook]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iOS]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[app]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[apple music]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[music app]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[ipad]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iphone 12]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iphone 12 pro]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[denim app]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iphone 12 pro max]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://fueled.com/?p=28327</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Oh, how I love music.

I really do and my wife’s deep bond to the classics has just helped that grow. I can’t count how many custom playlists I’ve created in the Music app for pretty much every occasion. Road trip tunes, workout blast, morning routine, chill vibes, psych up hits, reception playlist, and yeah — a lot more. Denim is a new app with a simple job to do: help you create custom icons for all of your personal playlists.\r\n\r\nComprised of three collections with several categories and more than 60 base pieces of artwork, Denim has a large availability of artwork for you to start with. Choose any of the provided artwork from within Denim, overlay your text, and *boom,* you have your latest playlist cover.\r\n\r\nAfter downloading the app, some artwork is available for free but the bulk is tied to a low-cost in-app purchase. There are soft gradients, classic looks, swirls, images, and more to choose between. The developer also pledges to continue to add additional artwork via updates as well.\r\n<div class=\"content-block--bg\">\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-28340\" src=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Denim-App-Showcase-02.png\" alt=\"denim app screens\" width=\"1440\" height=\"814\" srcset=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Denim-App-Showcase-02.png 1440w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Denim-App-Showcase-02-300x170.png 300w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Denim-App-Showcase-02-768x434.png 768w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Denim-App-Showcase-02-1024x579.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" />\r\n\r\nThese custom album covers don’t just show on your iPhone, they sync via Apple Music. Which many anywhere you listen to your music, these covers show. Your Apple Watch, your CarPlay interface, your iPad, your Mac, and even your Apple TV. I use this with Apple Music for Spotify users, you can use Denim as well.\r\n\r\nDeveloper Ashwin Srihari has done a swell job focusing on the styling of iOS apps, which is important as a design app such as this. Using the app looks almost similar to Apple’s Music app. Looking at workweeks you have small album art-like rounded squares with the collections with categories below that look similar to Apple Music categories and playlists. This is brilliant as it is an easy way to see how your music can look.\r\n\r\nThis app is oh so simple but has such a great purpose. I hate the static, stock images for personalized playlists but I&#8217;m not about to try to create my own in Pixelmator each time I spin up a playlist. Ashwin took a common problem, created an elegant solution to solve it, and priced it low enough to make it an easy impulse purchase for any design-loving music fan.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class=\"align--center p--large\">But enough about other people&#8217;s apps.</p>\r\n<p class=\"align--center\"><a class=\"btn link--btn link--btn-accent\" href=\"https://fueled.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LET&#8217;S TALK ABOUT YOURS</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fueled.com/blog/denim/\">Denim is Simple with a Purpose</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fueled.com\">Fueled</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://fueled.com/blog/denim/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Liftr — A Delightful Workout App for iPhone</title>\n\t\t<link>https://fueled.com/blog/liftr-workout-app/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://fueled.com/blog/liftr-workout-app/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2021 14:45:02 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Andrew O'Hara]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[App of the Week]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[apps]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iphone]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[smartphone]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[apple]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iOS]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[health app]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[fitness app]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[app]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iphone 12]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iphone 12 pro]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iphone 12 max]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[fitness gym app]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[workout app]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[gym app]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://fueled.com/?p=28326</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Track.

Everything. That’s the mindset behind the development behind the latest app I’ve become obsessed with. <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/liftr/id1277240548\">Liftr</a> is a delightful workout-tracking app for iPhone that is surprisingly robust, frequently updated, a beautiful on the small screen.\r\n<div class=\"content-block--bg content-block--bg-red\">\r\n\r\nI’ve never been a so-called “gym rat” but I have cared enough to work hard towards filling my <a href=\"https://fueled.com/developers-for-apple-watch\">Apple Watch</a> ring one way or another. I don’t always go to the gym but I’ll turn on workouts for extra-hard yard work to make sure it counts. When I do workout in my home gym — a.k.a. half to the living room with a set of collapsable weights and a bench — I need some help keeping track of what I’m doing. I’ve legit tried many apps for tracking what I do when it comes to weights and I always just bail and wing it. Tracking your gym entries for weights is always a ton of text fields and the apps look boring and flat. Not the case with Liftr.\r\n\r\nThere are quite a few components of Liftr that caught my eye when I stumbled upon it on the app store. First is the color scheme. The app slays in a rich purple scheme with slight gradients throughout. The app doesn’t pull out the full skeumorphism playbook but is relishing at its slight comeback with drop shadows abound. If used too much it can look hokey but Liftr employs them sparingly which gives some depth and layers to the number of text fields needed for copious weight tracking.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"content-block--bg\">\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-28337\" src=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Liftr-App-Showcase-02.png\" alt=\"liftr app screens\" width=\"1440\" height=\"814\" srcset=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Liftr-App-Showcase-02.png 1440w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Liftr-App-Showcase-02-300x170.png 300w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Liftr-App-Showcase-02-768x434.png 768w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Liftr-App-Showcase-02-1024x579.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" />\r\n\r\nThe app is broken down into workouts, charts, and goals. The charts are exceptional with a large variety to choose from. See your week based on pounds lifted or sets accomplished. Visualize your week by body part — how much was spent on your back? Or your shoulders? Or maybe those glutes? It is very useful to see these overviews in making decisions and they are just cool to look at and see your progress.\r\n\r\nWithin the app is an encompassing array of workouts and — at least with my limited skillset — always had the ones I routinely do indexed. It was also useful for discovering new workouts that I could filter by the equipment I had on-hand or by muscle group. What’s more, each workout had a corresponding icon to go with. I love a good icon and Liftr’s icon work is onpoint.\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy features for lifting include specific goals — i.e. number of pounds to lift, how many sets you do with your quads, or how many bench presses — and an equipment inventory that you can use to learn more about the tools you use to improve yourself. Tracking all of this is very easy with a shocking amount of detail. There are templates you can create for custom workouts, slots for sets, reps, weight, and rest, and much more. Anything not listed, add some extra notes.\r\n\r\nLIftr isn’t just a fantastic workout tracker, it is a first-class iOS citizen as well. For the latest iOS 14, Liftr offers up widgets to add to your Home Screen. These can show the various charts you’ve added in the app or specific goals.

Libby hails from RBdigital before it was purchased by OverDrive, another app for checking out digital library books. Libby though, is special.\r\n\r\nWhile I have a fantastic local library in Dublin, Ohio, I’m used to most libraries being under- funded city buildings that are trying their best to provide a much-needed service to their community. I wouldn’t expect an app that marries their physical counterpart with the digital world to be as aesthetically pleasing or as wonderful to use.\r\n\r\nThe app is split between two primary parts. There is the library side that allows you to peruse for new books or audiobooks you may be interested in. Then there is the “shelf” side which is any books you’ve already checked out and want to read or listen to.\r\n\r\nDigging into the design, Libby takes full advantage of the iPhone’s native display. Libby appears to be using Apple’s AutoLayout tool so that it magically adjusts based on any the screen’s size. This means even though the phones just launched, it fits perfectly on the new screen size of the iPhone 12 Pro Max and iPhone 12 mini.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div class=\"content-block--bg\">\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-28305\" src=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Libby-App-Showcase-02.png\" alt=\"libby app screens\" width=\"1440\" height=\"814\" srcset=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Libby-App-Showcase-02.png 1440w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Libby-App-Showcase-02-300x170.png 300w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Libby-App-Showcase-02-768x434.png 768w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Libby-App-Showcase-02-1024x579.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" />\r\n\r\nLibby often employs two-toned displays and the top half has a full-bleed to fill the notch on Apple’s Face ID-enabled devices. At the bottom, the center icon sits just atop the Home indicator without getting to close. Book art is always large and prominent, icons are unique and easy to interpret, and the colors are bold but lean into the pastel side which makes them easier on the eyes. It’s all very polished.\r\n\r\nSearching for something new to read couldn’t be easier. Libby breaks it down into multiple categories including curated ones such as what is popular. When you find a book you think you may like, you can read a sample, tag it, or check it out. If you want to borrow a book but it is already checked out by others and unavailable, you can place a hold to save your place in line. When it is ready for you, you’ll get a notification.\r\n\r\nLibby has built in support for many native features found on iPhones and iPads. It is quick and easy to send a digital eBook straight to the Kindle app which is many’s preferred reader. If you have a vehicle that supports CarPlay there is an car version of the app to listen to your audiobooks while on the road. And just after the launch of iOS 14, Libby launched a new Home Screen widget so you can jump right into your books without having to first launch the app. I love reading and finding new books to delve into, but without the library, it can get quite expensive. Libby allows you to take advantage of your digital devices right in front of you and is absolutely free to use. It brings you this incredible service with a slick-as-heck app that I find myself sinking more and more time into.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class=\"align--center p--large\">But enough about other people&#8217;s apps.</p>\r\n<p class=\"align--center\"><a class=\"btn link--btn link--btn-accent\" href=\"https://fueled.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LET&#8217;S TALK ABOUT YOURS</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fueled.com/blog/libby/\">While You Stay At Home, Catch Up on Your Reading with Libby</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fueled.com\">Fueled</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://fueled.com/blog/libby/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Craft is the Note-Taking App That’s Saved Me From Headaches</title>\n\t\t<link>https://fueled.com/blog/craft-note-taking-app/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://fueled.com/blog/craft-note-taking-app/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 06 Jan 2021 14:45:10 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Andrew O'Hara]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[App of the Week]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[apps]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iphone]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[google]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[smartphone]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[apple]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Android]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iOS]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[note taking app]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[notes app]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[app]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iphone 11 pro]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iphone 12 pro]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[note app]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[craft]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iphone 12 max]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iphone 11 pro max]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://fueled.com/?p=28302</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>If any of you out there have been early adopts of an app, you may be used to the often shallow feature set and occasional bugs that come with.

Very rarely do I meander across a 1.0 app release that is so elegantly designed and well-implemented that it crushes any of my expectations and preconceived notions about what a note taking app can do. I don’t mean to try to over-sell Craft but it truly has blown me away. It is both visually striking as well as incredibly robust and works across your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.\r\n<div class=\"content-block--bg content-block--bg-red\">\r\n\r\nLuki Labs has put much effort in to how you interact with Craft. That includes using external peripherals such as the Magic Keyboard or the touchscreen. Near everything can be dragged and dropped, text can be swiped left or right to change its style with a slick on-screen menu, and a Quick Menu can be invoked with just a /.\r\n\r\nTo keep things concise, I’ll say this: anything you’d expect to see in a text editor is here. You can style your text, change the size, adjust the color, and plenty more. Notes can be tagged, organized, and nested. Not to mention some fantastic sharing options.\r\n\r\nUnlike a lot of modern text editors that keep things simple and focus on the text, Craft puts just as much emphasis on the visual style of your notes. You can place an optional header image on your note that fits right in. These hero images are placed with slightly rounded corners and inlaid credits nearest the lower-right corner. You can create styled blocks with your note that have light background colors to help them stand out and can be grouped into rows and columns.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"content-block--bg\">\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-28312\" src=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Craft-App-Showcase-02.png\" alt=\"craft notes app screens\" width=\"1440\" height=\"814\" srcset=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Craft-App-Showcase-02.png 1440w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Craft-App-Showcase-02-300x170.png 300w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Craft-App-Showcase-02-768x434.png 768w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Craft-App-Showcase-02-1024x579.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" />Organization is a massive pillar within Craft. Notes can be organized into folders and can be nested as needed. When in a note, there is a small angled arrow in the top left corner to take you back to the main screen. On iPad, if in a nested note, as you approach that corner with your cursor, the breadcrumb trail appears. It is a wonderful little touch. Now, when I say notes can be nested, I mean literally nested into one another. These linked notes are fantastic for staying organized. Luki Labs made this visually beautiful by created a box around the linked note and an overlaid snippet of text from the connected note that decreases in opacity as it approaches the bounds of the box.\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, there are oodles of Apple-specific features here, all natively created. The onscreen menu that appears when you tap the / key is a godsend, pulling up the ability to run actions, style a list, change color, insert media, and much more. If using a keyboard, it can be controlled with the arrow keys. Just so intuitive and thought-out. When you launch the app for the first time, you can get started almost instantly by using Sign In with Apple. This protects your privacy and simplifies the onboarding process. There are also widgets here for your iOS 14 devices.\r\n\r\nPossibly the most impressive single feature is real-time collaboration. You don’t just share notes, but you can both edit a note at the same time a la Google Docs or Apple Pages. Craft asks you to create a “Space” before inviting others to join. It will show an activity feed of what changes have been made, saves backups and versioning, and in-note comments. It is more robust than I’d even hope for.\r\n\r\nNo joke, I could write twice this volume going into every detail on Craft but the app is best explored for yourself. Craft has a delightful onboarding flow where you try out the features for yourself to familiarize yourself with app. Oh, it also happens to be entirely free to use. The free version includes 1000 blocks of text and PDF export while Craft Pro includes unlimited use, 30 day version history, in-doc search, high-res image and video uploads, and additional card effects. In my mind, it is easily worth it. Paying subscriber right here, and proud of it. If you take notes — whether a lot of a little — I implore you to give Craft a try. As the name implies, this app has been intricate crafted to be powerful and wonderful to use on any device you need it. Dive in for free and see how much better Craft is than Apple’s own Notes app or even the forsaken remains of Evernote. You can thank me later.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"align--center p--large\">But enough about other people&#8217;s apps.</p>\r\n<p class=\"align--center\"><a class=\"btn link--btn link--btn-accent\" href=\"https://fueled.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LET&#8217;S TALK ABOUT YOURS</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fueled.com/blog/craft-note-taking-app/\">Craft is the Note-Taking App That’s Saved Me From Headaches</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fueled.com\">Fueled</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://fueled.com/blog/craft-note-taking-app/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>PicSew does much more than your average photo stitcher</title>\n\t\t<link>https://fueled.com/blog/picsew-photo-stitcher/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://fueled.com/blog/picsew-photo-stitcher/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 23 Dec 2020 14:45:04 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Andrew O'Hara]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[App of the Week]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[apps]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iphone]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[google]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[smartphone]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[apple]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iOS]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[app of the week]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[app]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[andoird]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[photo editing app]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iphone 11 pro]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[photo app]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[image app]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[picture app]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iphone 11]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iphone 12]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iphone 12 pro]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[picture]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[pictureeditor]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[picture editor app]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[image]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[image apps]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://fueled.com/?p=28289</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160; We’ve all done it.

Whether a web page or a text thread, we’ve taken multiple screenshots and then either sent them all piecemeal or tried stitching them together with some rather shady app we’ve found on the App Store that decently gets the job done. Needless to say PicSew is both a nicely polished app but packed full of additional features and multiple tiers so that you only pay for what you need.\r\n\r\nFirst things first — stitching your screenshots. Yes, PicSew does this with ease. Feed it multiple shots you’ve taken and it will easily merge them into a single shareable image. It scans the images for overlapping areas and saves you the hassle of sending multiple images. What we found most impressive is a feature included in the “pro” tier. All you need is a screen recording of a webpage, conversation, news article, email, etc. That video is sucked into PicSew and a stitched image comes out the other end.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"content-block--bg\">\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-28297\" src=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Picsew-App-Showcase-02.png\" alt=\"picsew app screens\" width=\"1440\" height=\"814\" srcset=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Picsew-App-Showcase-02.png 1440w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Picsew-App-Showcase-02-300x170.png 300w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Picsew-App-Showcase-02-768x434.png 768w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Picsew-App-Showcase-02-1024x579.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" />\r\nPicSew also comes with additional image manipulation tools. You’re able to watermark images before you share them. Sensitive information is able to be redacted. Borders can be added around the image. And you can annotate images by drawing with your finger, or Apple Pencil ifyou’re on iPad.\r\n\r\nWith the most recent major update, PicSew added support for iOS 14 widgets. The widget monitors your screenshots to alert you when a new “ScrollShot” is detected. You can tap right into it and share using the native iOS Share Sheet.\r\n\r\nIf you want to get really fancy, PicSew has support for the X-Callback-URL schema which is a universal standard for interapp communication. We’re able to use this with Apple’s Shortcuts app to create some extraordinary and complex workflows thanks to this feature.\r\n\r\nWhile there is a lot of functionality here the app keeps the interface simple. Clean colors and simplistic self-explanatory icons make the app comfortable and familiar. Any user will be able to find their with through PicSew.\r\n\r\nSo whether you want to stitch screenshots together, join pictures of your pets (or kids, I guess&#8230;) into one image, retract some personal information on a screenshot, watermark a pic you took, or create an elaborate Shortcuts workflow, PicSew has you covered.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class=\"align--center p--large\">But enough about other people&#8217;s apps.</p>\r\n<p class=\"align--center\"><a class=\"btn link--btn link--btn-accent\" href=\"https://fueled.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LET&#8217;S TALK ABOUT YOURS</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fueled.com/blog/picsew-photo-stitcher/\">PicSew does much more than your average photo stitcher</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fueled.com\">Fueled</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://fueled.com/blog/picsew-photo-stitcher/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Newsdrop is the minimalist news reader I was looking for</title>\n\t\t<link>https://fueled.com/blog/newsdrop-minimalist-news/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://fueled.com/blog/newsdrop-minimalist-news/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 16 Dec 2020 14:45:03 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Andrew O'Hara]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[App of the Week]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[apps]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iphone]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[google]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[smartphone]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[apple]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[mac]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Android]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iOS]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[news app]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[app]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[news]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iphone 11 pro]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iphone 11]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iphone 12]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iphone 12 pro]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://fueled.com/?p=28288</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Gosh, I have a problem with news apps.

I’ve already written about one or two of them here as some of my favorites and while I standby how amazing they were, I’ve also gotten attached to Newsdrop. It is a minimalist, curated newsfeed of relevant information for my iPhone and Apple Watch that is as practical as it is gorgeous.\r\n\r\nOften times I’m looking for a quick fix of news, so I skim headlines. But I also am well-aware that headlines don’t always tell the whole story and I don’t want to draw assumptions. Newsdrop’s editors will summarize the best articles and include all of the necessary information in under 200 words.\r\n\r\nThat isn’t to say longer content isn’t highlighted. While most articles can be gleaned right from the feed, it&#8217;s only a tap away to read the article in its entirety. Also features long-form articles for when you have the time to kickback and a selection of videos.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"content-block--bg\">\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-28291\" src=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Newsdrop-App-Showcase-02.png\" alt=\"newsdrop app screens\" width=\"1440\" height=\"814\" srcset=\"https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Newsdrop-App-Showcase-02.png 1440w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Newsdrop-App-Showcase-02-300x170.png 300w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Newsdrop-App-Showcase-02-768x434.png 768w, https://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Newsdrop-App-Showcase-02-1024x579.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" />\r\nNewsdrop, even in its free form, offers quite a few customization options for users to make the experience more tailored to them. There are multiple themes to choose from, including an OLED-specific version with pure blacks. You can also disable image downloads which aids with saving on data and load times. Stories can be bookmarked for further perusal. With the paid, ad-free version of Newsdrop you get the aforementioned OLED theme, unlimited bookmarks, and access to old articles. For us, it was easily worth the splurge of $7.99 a year.\r\n\r\nThe devs have done a great job designing the app, keeping things clean and light (unless you’re using that OLED theme). The basic theme has a text on a white plain with a gray background. The icons and text are all also gray rather than full black which makes it a bit easier on the eyes and more modern. Images have full bleed to fill the display edge-to-edge, and videos are nicely embedded.\r\n\r\nWhat makes it most worth it for me is support for Apple Watch. Quick, skimmable news is perfect for the Apple Watch’s small display where you may not want to read a long article but are good for a few paragraphs of relevant information.\r\n\r\nI still may wind up with another news app or even the default News app, but I don’t think I’ll be ditching Newsdrop completely anytime soon. It gives me the most information on my Apple Watch, it is quickest to read and skim when I’m busy, and all the news comes from sources I trust. If you’re looking for a new way to stay up-to-date and learn a bit, then check out Newsdrop.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class=\"align--center p--large\">But enough about other people&#8217;s apps.</p>\r\n<p class=\"align--center\"><a class=\"btn link--btn link--btn-accent\" href=\"https://fueled.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LET&#8217;S TALK ABOUT YOURS</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fueled.com/blog/newsdrop-minimalist-news/\">Newsdrop is the minimalist news reader I was looking for</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fueled.com\">Fueled</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://fueled.com/blog/newsdrop-minimalist-news/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>\n"},"redirectURL":"","headersSize":-1,"bodySize":76052},"cache":{},"timings":{"blocked":-1,"dns":-1,"connect":-1,"ssl":-1,"send":2.5130999982357025,"wait":873.4687999933958,"receive":166.66189999878407}},{"pageref":"Embarcadero","startedDateTime":"2021-02-23T16:57:27.369-07:00","time":164.27930000424385,"request":{"method":"GET","url":"https://hackaday.com/blog/feed/","httpVersion":"HTTP/1.1","cookies":[],"headers":[{"name":"connection","value":"Keep-Alive"},{"name":"cookie","value":"country_code=US;

In his latest Applied Science video, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wZ0wTqJIxY\" target=\"_blank\">[Ben Krasnow] tries to measure how efficient the human body is at getting energy from food</a> by accurately measuring what he put in and what comes out of his body.</p>\n<p>The jumping off point for this experiment is the calorie count on the back of food packaging. [Ben] touches on &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.chem.hope.edu/~polik/Chem345-2000/bombcalorimetry.htm\" target=\"_blank\">bomb calorimetry</a>&#8221; &#8212; the process of burning foodstuff in an oxygen-rich environment and measuring the heat given off to establish how much energy was present in the sample. But our bodies are flameless&#8230; can we really extract similar amounts of energy as these highly controlled combustion chambers? His solution is to measure his body&#8217;s intake by eating nothing but Soylent for a week, then subjects his body&#8217;s waste to the bomb calorimetry treatment to calculate how much energy was not absorbed during digestion. (He burned his poop for science, and made fun of some YouTubers at the same time.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ben-krasnow-bomb-calorimetry-water-bath.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img data-attachment-id=\"463898\" data-permalink=\"https://hackaday.com/2021/02/23/ben-krasnow-measures-human-calorie-consumption-by-collecting-the-output/ben-krasnow-bomb-calorimetry-water-bath/\" data-orig-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ben-krasnow-bomb-calorimetry-water-bath.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1268,713\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"ben-krasnow-bomb-calorimetry-water-bath\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ben-krasnow-bomb-calorimetry-water-bath.jpg?w=400\" data-large-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ben-krasnow-bomb-calorimetry-water-bath.jpg?w=800\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-463898\" src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ben-krasnow-bomb-calorimetry-water-bath.jpg?w=400\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ben-krasnow-bomb-calorimetry-water-bath.jpg 1268w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ben-krasnow-bomb-calorimetry-water-bath.jpg?resize=250,141 250w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ben-krasnow-bomb-calorimetry-water-bath.jpg?resize=400,225 400w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ben-krasnow-bomb-calorimetry-water-bath.jpg?resize=800,450 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></a>The test apparatus is a cool build &#8212; a chunk of pipe with an acrylic/glass laminated window that has a bicycle tire value for pressurization, a pressure gauge, and electrodes to spark the combustion using nichrome wire and cotton string. It&#8217;s shown above, burning a Goldfish® cracker but it&#8217;s not actually measuring the energy output as this is just a test run. The actual measurements call for the combustion chamber to be submerged in an insulated water bath so that the temperature change can be measured.</p>\n<p>Now to the dirty bits. [Ben] collected fecal matter and freeze-dried it to ready it for the calorimeter. His preparation for the experiment included eating nothing but Soylent (a powdered foodstuff) to achieve an input baseline. The problem is that he measures the fecal matter to have about 75% of the calories per gram compared to the Soylent. Thinking on it, that&#8217;s not surprising as we know that dung must have a high caloric level &#8212; it burns and has been used throughout history as a source of warmth among other things. But the numbers don&#8217;t lead to an obvious conclusion and [Ben] doesn&#8217;t have the answer on why the measurements came out this way. In the YouTube comments [Bitluni] asks the question that was on our minds: how do you correlate the volume of the input and output? Is comparing 1g of Soylent to 1g of fecal matter a correct equivalency? Let us know what you think the comments below.</p>\n<p>The science of poop is one of those 8th-grade giggle topics, but still totally fascinating.

But each pip is only an abstraction, an aural indication of when a particle or ray of ionizing radiation passed through a detector. Knowing <em>where</em> that happened might be important, too, under the right circumstances.</p>\n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHtWm_O3MS4\" target=\"_blank\">this plasma radiation detector</a> is designed more as a demonstration, it does a pretty good job at localizing where ionization events are happening. Designed and built by [Jay Bowles], the detector is actually pretty simple. Since [Jay] is the type of fellow with plenty of spare high-voltage power supplies lying around, he took a 6 kV flyback supply from an old build and used it here. The detector consists of a steel disk underneath a network of fine wires. Perched atop a frame of acrylic and powered by a 9 V battery, the circuit puts high-voltage across the plate and the wires. After a substantial amount of tweaking, [Jay] got it adjusted so that passing alpha particles from a sample of americium-241 left an ionization trail between the conductors, leading to a miniature lightning bolt.</p>\n<p>In the video below, the detector sounds very similar to a Geiger counter, but with the added benefit of a built-in light show. We like the way it looks and works, although we&#8217;d perhaps advise a little more caution to anyone disassembling a smoke detector. Especially if you&#8217;re taking apart Soviet-era smoke alarms &#8212; you might get <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2017/02/09/soviet-era-smoke-detector-torn-down-revealing-plutonium/\">more than you bargained for</a>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-462200\"></span></p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='800' height='480' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/zHtWm_O3MS4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://hackaday.com/2021/02/23/plasma-discharges-show-you-where-the-radiation-is/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>8</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">462200</post-id>\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/plasma-radiation-detector.png\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/plasma-radiation-detector.png\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">plasma radiation detector</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Paul Taylor Opened the Lines of Telecommunication for the Hearing-Impaired</title>\n\t\t<link>https://hackaday.com/2021/02/23/paul-taylor-opened-the-lines-of-telecommunication-for-the-hearing-impaired/</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<comments>https://hackaday.com/2021/02/23/paul-taylor-opened-the-lines-of-telecommunication-for-the-hearing-impaired/#comments</comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Kristina Panos]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 18:01:16 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Biography]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Featured]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Interest]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Original Art]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[profiles in science]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[tdd]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[telecommunication device for the deaf]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[telecommunications relay service]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[teletypewriter]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[tty]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://hackaday.com/?p=461050</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>These days, nearly everyone communicates through some kind of keyboard, whether they are texting, emailing, or posting on various internet discussion forums.

At the age of three, his mother sent him by train to St. Louis to live at a boarding school called the Central Institute for the Deaf (CID).</p>\n<p>Here, he was outfitted with a primitive hearing aid and learned to read lips, speak, and use American sign language. At the time, this was the standard plan for deaf and hearing-impaired children &#8212; to attend such a school for a decade or so and graduate with the social and academic tools they needed to succeed in public high schools and universities.</p>\n<p>After college, Paul became an engineer and in his free time, a champion for the deaf community. He was a pioneer of Telecommunications Devices for the Deaf, better known as TDD or TTY equipment in the US. Later in life, he helped write legislation that became part of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2021/02/he-died-in-portland-his-legacy-of-helping-the-deaf-communicate-with-the-world.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Paul was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#8217;s in 2017 and died in January of 2021 at the age of 81</a>. He always believed that the more access a deaf person had to technology, the better their life would be, and spent much of his life trying to use technology to improve the deaf experience.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-461050\"></span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_461647\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-461647\" style=\"width: 400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Paul-high-school.jpeg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"461647\" data-permalink=\"https://hackaday.com/2021/02/23/paul-taylor-opened-the-lines-of-telecommunication-for-the-hearing-impaired/paul-high-school/\" data-orig-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Paul-high-school.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"670,496\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Paul-high-school\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Paul-high-school.jpeg?w=400\" data-large-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Paul-high-school.jpeg?w=670\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-461647 size-medium\" src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Paul-high-school.jpeg?w=400\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"296\" srcset=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Paul-high-school.jpeg 670w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Paul-high-school.jpeg?resize=250,185 250w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Paul-high-school.jpeg?resize=400,296 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-461647\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">High school-aged Paul.

Along with their classmates, they spent the next several years learning to speak by holding their hands to the teacher&#8217;s face to feel the vibrations of speech, then touching their own faces while mimicking the movement and sound.</p>\n<p>Paul&#8217;s father died while he was still in school. His mother moved to St. Louis to be with her son so he could still attend, but live at home. She took the opportunity to study at CID and she became an accredited teacher for deaf children. When it was time for high school, Paul and his mother moved to Houston, where she started a school for the deaf, and he enrolled in public school for the first time. Paul had no interpreter, no helper of any kind.</p>\n<p>In a 2007 documentary made by the Taylors&#8217; youngest daughter, Paul tells a story about an experience he had in high school. There was a nice looking girl in his class, and he wanted to know more about her, so he asked a different girl who she was. When that girl offered to give Paul the first girl&#8217;s telephone number, he stopped in his tracks, realizing at that moment how different he was because he couldn&#8217;t use the phone like all the other kids. The experience stuck with him and helped drive his life&#8217;s work.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_461639\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-461639\" style=\"width: 400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/picturephone.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img data-attachment-id=\"461639\" data-permalink=\"https://hackaday.com/2021/02/23/paul-taylor-opened-the-lines-of-telecommunication-for-the-hearing-impaired/picturephone/\" data-orig-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/picturephone.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"840,662\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"picturephone\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/picturephone.jpg?w=400\" data-large-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/picturephone.jpg?w=793\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-461639 size-medium\" src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/picturephone.jpg?w=400\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"315\" srcset=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/picturephone.jpg 840w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/picturephone.jpg?resize=250,197 250w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/picturephone.jpg?resize=400,315 400w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/picturephone.jpg?resize=793,625 793w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-461639\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">AT&amp;T&#8217;s Picturephone as it premiered at the 1964 World&#8217;s Fair.

In the meantime, Sally, who had gone to high school in St. Louis, earned her bachelor&#8217;s degree in home economics and returned to CID to teach physical education, religion, and home economics. When Paul learned that Sally was living in town, he got in touch with her immediately. They started dating and were engaged six months later.</p>\n<p>Paul took Sally to the 1964 World&#8217;s Fair in Queens, New York for their first anniversary. They marveled at <a href=\"https://mashable.com/2014/04/20/videophone-turns-50/\" target=\"_blank\">AT&amp;T&#8217;s Picturephone</a> and wished the future would arrive sooner so they could easily talk from anywhere by reading each other&#8217;s lips. By day, Paul was an engineer at McDonnell Douglas and later, Monsanto. He was a different kind of engineer at home, devising different ways to help raise their three hearing children. After their first child was born, Paul built a system that would blink the lights in the house to let them know the baby was crying.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_461628\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-461628\" style=\"width: 325px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Paul-Sally-David-TTY.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img data-attachment-id=\"461628\" data-permalink=\"https://hackaday.com/2021/02/23/paul-taylor-opened-the-lines-of-telecommunication-for-the-hearing-impaired/paul-sally-david-tty/\" data-orig-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Paul-Sally-David-TTY.png\" data-orig-size=\"544,670\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Paul-Sally-David-TTY\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Paul-Sally-David-TTY.png?w=325\" data-large-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Paul-Sally-David-TTY.png?w=507\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-461628 size-medium\" src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Paul-Sally-David-TTY.png?w=325\" alt=\"\" width=\"325\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Paul-Sally-David-TTY.png 544w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Paul-Sally-David-TTY.png?resize=203,250 203w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Paul-Sally-David-TTY.png?resize=325,400 325w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Paul-Sally-David-TTY.png?resize=507,625 507w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-461628\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Paul, Sally, and their son David along with one of the first teletypewriters that was repurposed as a telecommunication device for the deaf.

The phone problem still bothered him greatly. When he noticed an old Western Union teletype machine from WWII just sitting around collecting dust, he got the idea to turn it into a new kind of communication tool.</p>\n<p>Around the same time, a deaf physicist named <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Weitbrecht\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Weitbrecht</a> was developing an acoustic coupler that would transmit teletype signals over consumer phone lines. Paul got Weitbrecht to send him one and created one of the first telecommunication devices for the deaf (TDD). With one of these devices on each end of the phone line, anything typed on one would be printed out on the other. Paul worked with Western Union to get these old teletypewriters into the hands of hearing and speaking-impaired people, and convinced AT&amp;T to create a relay service to use them as well.</p>\n<p>Paul started a non-profit organization to distribute these early TDDs to other deaf St. Louisans. He asked a local telephone wake-up call service to help out, and <a href=\"https://tdiforaccess.org/paul-taylor-one-of-the-early-tty-activists-dies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">built one of the first telephone relay systems in the process</a>. Although both parties needed a TDD to be able to communicate, this was a big step in the right direction.</p>\n<p>Paul also did a lot of work to keep the machines humming for the people who depended on them. Teletypewriter manuals were helpful, but were awfully dense reading material for the layman. Paul organized a week-long workshop to create <a href=\"https://www.smecc.org/teletypewriters_made_easy.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a picture-rich manual called Teletypewriters Made Easy</a> to help people repair and maintain three common models of teletypewriter. Paul discusses his personal history with TDD development in the video below.</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='800' height='480' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/U2_skVb8Qpw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>\n<h2 style=\"clear: none;\">A Loud Voice for the Deaf Community</h2>\n<p>In 1975, Paul was offered a position at the National Institute for the Deaf at Rochester Institute of Technology, so the Taylor family moved to upstate New York. Paul became a computer technology professor and chairman of the Engineering Support team. He stayed there for the next 30 years before retiring.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_461653\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-461653\" style=\"width: 400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/TTY.jpeg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"461653\" data-permalink=\"https://hackaday.com/2021/02/23/paul-taylor-opened-the-lines-of-telecommunication-for-the-hearing-impaired/tty-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/TTY.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"792,581\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"TTY\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/TTY.jpeg?w=400\" data-large-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/TTY.jpeg?w=792\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-461653 size-medium\" src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/TTY.jpeg?w=400\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"293\" srcset=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/TTY.jpeg 792w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/TTY.jpeg?resize=250,183 250w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/TTY.jpeg?resize=400,293 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-461653\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A more modern TTY.

Paul took a two-year leave of absence from teaching and worked directly with the FCC to write regulations that became part of the guidelines prescribed in the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (<a href=\"https://www.ada.gov/ada_intro.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ADA</a>).</p>\n<h2 style=\"clear: none;\">Learning How to Hear</h2>\n<p>At the age of 65, Paul and Sally decided to get cochlear implants after a lifetime of silence. Their youngest daughter Irene made a documentary about their experience called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hear_and_Now\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Hear and Now</em></a>, which is embedded below. It&#8217;s an interesting firsthand look into the process, which is not the instant cure that the internet may have led you to believe. The implant can&#8217;t be activated until the swelling from surgery goes down, which takes about a month. And it can take years for the brain to get used the new sensory information and begin to distinguish relevant sounds from background noise.</p>\n<p>Although TTY/TDDs are falling out of use thanks to the videophone-enabled text messaging devices in most people&#8217;s pockets, their influence on communication lives on in shorthand now used in our everyday messages &#8212; OIC, PLS, and THX are older than you might think.</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='800' height='480' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/j6LfG7dpK08?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>\n<p>Thanks for the tip, [Zoobab].</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://hackaday.com/2021/02/23/paul-taylor-opened-the-lines-of-telecommunication-for-the-hearing-impaired/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>7</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">461050</post-id>\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PaulTaylor.jpg\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PaulTaylor.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">PaulTaylor</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Paul-TTY.jpeg?w=400\" medium=\"image\" />\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Paul-high-school.jpeg?w=400\" medium=\"image\" />\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/picturephone.jpg?w=400\" medium=\"image\" />\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Paul-Sally-David-TTY.png?w=325\" medium=\"image\" />\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/TTY.jpeg?w=400\" medium=\"image\" />\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Useful Build Tips For Making LED Panel Frames</title>\n\t\t<link>https://hackaday.com/2021/02/23/useful-build-tips-for-making-led-panel-frames/</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<comments>https://hackaday.com/2021/02/23/useful-build-tips-for-making-led-panel-frames/#comments</comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Donald Papp]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 16:30:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[how-to]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[LED Hacks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[3d printing]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[aluminum extrusion]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[bezel]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[enclosure]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[frame]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[LED panel]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[magnetic]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[raspberry pi]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://hackaday.com/?p=462079</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>[NotLikeALeafOnTheWind] has created many LED-based display projects, and shares his method for making attractive LED panel frames and mounts.

There can be small differences between what a data sheet says to expect, and the dimensions of the actual part in one&#8217;s hands. It may not be much, but it can be the difference between an ideal fit, and something that looks like a bit of a hack job.</p>\n<p>[NotLikeALeafOnTheWind] provides some basic frame layouts, and suggests using two- or three-channel extrusions to provide a flat bezel around the display edge if desired. Mounting the LED panel itself is done with magnetic feet and providing a length of steel bar to which the display can attach. This can provide a flush mount while avoiding the whole issue of screw-mounting the display panels themselves, or sliding them into channels. For mounting all the other hardware, a piece of DIN rail and some 3D-printed parts takes care of that.</p>\n<p>The result looks slick and sturdy, and some of the tips are sure to be useful even if the whole process isn&#8217;t applied. We like the way the basic design scales and is flexible about the thickness and size of the LED panels themselves, making it a promising way to accommodate <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2020/05/09/reverse-engineering-saves-trashed-led-panels/\">perfectly functional oddball panels that end up in the trash</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://hackaday.com/2021/02/23/useful-build-tips-for-making-led-panel-frames/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>6</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">462079</post-id>\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/LED-Panel-frame-wide.jpg\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/LED-Panel-frame-wide.jpg\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">LED Panel frame wide</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/LED-Panel-magnetic-feet.jpg?w=250\" medium=\"image\" />\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Hands on With the Ortur Laser Cutter</title>\n\t\t<link>https://hackaday.com/2021/02/23/hands-on-with-the-ortur-laser-cutter/</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<comments>https://hackaday.com/2021/02/23/hands-on-with-the-ortur-laser-cutter/#comments</comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Al Williams]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 15:00:27 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[cnc hacks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Hackaday Columns]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Laser Hacks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[laser]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[laser cutter]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[laser engraver]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[laser engraving]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[ortur]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://hackaday.com/?p=458101</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>I couldn&#8217;t write very much without a computer.

Early in my career, I wrote with a typewriter. Unless you are pretty close to perfect &#8212; I&#8217;m not &#8212; it is very frustrating to make edits on typewritten stuff. The equivalent in the real world, for me, has been 3D printers and CNC machines. I can visualize a lot of things that I&#8217;m not careful enough to build with normal tools. Despite my 7th-grade shop teacher&#8217;s best efforts, everything I did turned out to be a toothpick or a number 7. But I can get my ideas into CAD and from there the machines do the rest. That&#8217;s why I was excited to get a laser cutter this past Christmas. You might wonder why I&#8217;d need a laser cutter if I have the other tools. Then again, if you read Hackaday, you probably don&#8217;t need me to explain why you need a new gadget. I&#8217;ve had my eye on a laser for a good long time, but recent developments made it more attractive. I thought I&#8217;d share with you some of what I&#8217;ve found getting started with the Ortur laser cutter. The cutter is easy to put together and costs somewhere in the $200-$400 range depending on what you get with it. I thought I&#8217;d take some time to share what I&#8217;ve learned about it.</p>\n<h2>Why a Laser?</h2>\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t had experience with a laser cutter or engraver before, you might think it is a very specific instrument. Sure, the Ortur is good at engraving some things (but not all things). It can cut some things, too, but not as many things as a big serious laser cutter. However, creative people find lots of ways to use cutting and engraving to produce things you might not expect.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-458101\"></span></p>\n<p>For example, if you surf YouTube, you&#8217;ll find people who put spray paint on either a ceramic tile or a canvas and then burn some or all of the paint away to make really interesting artwork. Sometimes they&#8217;ll even use multiple layers of paint to create different colors by burning different depths into the artwork. Another multicolor technique is to cut what amounts to a custom stencil in masking tape that is already applied to the part. You can then spray paint, remove the tape, apply fresh tape, and cut a new stencil for another color. Some people etch the backs of mirrors. It is also surprisingly handy to be able to precision cut paper and cardboard. However, with some practice and technique, you can even cut some thicknesses of plywood.</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='800' height='480' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/qRp8YWcTVKI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m very interested in creating PC boards either directly or by cutting resist and then using conventional etching techniques. People are <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2021/01/11/laser-blasts-out-high-quality-pcbs/\">doing that, too</a>. Depending on the power of your laser, you can cut quite a few things, although with a visible laser, you can&#8217;t cut things that are transparent. You can engrave more things, and even metal if you use some additional chemicals (like <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2021/01/02/laser-etching-stainless-steel-with-mustard/\">mustard</a>). In addition to line art and text, you can do halftone images from pictures. If you have a powerful enough laser, you can even <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2016/12/07/sintering-sand-with-a-laser-cutter/\">make glass</a>, sort of.</p>\n<p>Of course, in addition to all the artsy things, you can just cut material too, which is surprisingly handy. [Electronoobs] did a video last year experimenting with different materials with a 15W laser so that will give you some idea of what you can and can&#8217;t cut with this type of laser.</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='800' height='480' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/djRRxGXyACY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=742&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>\n<p>There are some things you shouldn&#8217;t cut because they emit noxious fumes like ABS or vinyl products. Leather engraves and cuts well but boy does it stink! I understand that you should be careful working with chrome tanned leather, too, because the tanning chemicals could emit bad fumes. Some materials are also too prone to bursting into flames like styrofoam.</p>\n<h2>About the Ortur</h2>\n<p>If you want a laser, your next problem is which one to buy. There are carbon dioxide lasers that are commonly available, but they are pretty pricey and are known to need a lot of effort &#8212; including a bucket of ice of water and ventilation &#8212; to use. Semiconductor lasers are cheap and much easier to use. These are generally visible which, as I mentioned, means you can&#8217;t use them to cut some things like clear acrylic. You can get some very inexpensive laser engravers, but many of them are probably not going to cut much.</p>\n<p>Then again, power isn&#8217;t everything. Broadly speaking, you can trade time for power with a laser. That is, a cut that might take a 10 watt laser a few seconds in a single pass might take a 1 watt laser four or five 30-second passes. It isn&#8217;t always simple because as the laser chars material it creates a barrier that prevents you from getting as much energy underneath. Still, you can sometimes do the same job with lower power if you are willing to take longer per pass and repeat the pass.</p>\n<p>The Ortur Laser Master 2 is reasonably priced and has three choices in laser power: 7W, 15W, and 20W. This is a little deceptive because the power is actually the input power to the module. The 15W unit, for example, produces less than 5W of output power, but that&#8217;s still able to do a lot more than you might think.</p>\n<p>The device is made to work with a free piece of Windows software called LaserGRBL that talks to the onboard GRBL controller. In theory, anything that would send G-code could work. I use Linux, so I opted for LightBurn which is excellent and well worth the $40 you&#8217;ll pay for it. It runs on multiple platforms, too, but sadly not on the Raspberry Pi, so I&#8217;ve had to drag a laptop out to work with the Ortur. You might also check out <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2016/07/17/open-source-laser-cutter-software-gets-major-update-new-features/\">LaserWeb</a>.</p>\n<p>There are other cheap laser engravers and cutters, but I was impressed with the Ortur&#8217;s size and capabilities. There&#8217;s also a lot of add on designs available for it and good support in software.</p>\n<h2>Assembly</h2>\n<p>The unit requires some assembly, although much of it is preassembled. You build a frame of aluminum extrusions and then slip the X carriage on. There&#8217;s a 32-bit controller board and some stepper motors. The 32-bit board is a big selling point. Some of the work you do with the laser requires PWM to modulate the beam&#8217;s power. Most 8-bit boards will allow you to step power from 0-255 so each step is about 0.4% of full strength. A 32-bit board will let you do around 1,000 divisions of full scale which gives you about 0.1% on each step.</p>\n<p>The mechanism is like a plotter or a 3D printer with no Z-axis. Since the laser doesn&#8217;t touch anything, it doesn&#8217;t need the robustness of a CNC setup. Of course, you can also <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2019/06/10/creating-a-laser-cutter-from-a-3d-printer/\">mount a laser to a 3D printer</a> or a <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2019/05/12/modular-cnc-build-gets-you-both-a-mill-and-a-laser-cutter/\">CNC machine</a> if you already have one and that&#8217;s not necessarily a bad option, although most of those setups have some limitations (for example, no modulation of beam intensity).</p>\n<p>The best way to see how to build the machine is to watch the company&#8217;s video instructions (see below). There are a few things unclear in the video and I made some <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aJPIKfMx7Ur_ad674ZeSWMdrsCks3VEN-A8xlimvojY/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">notes that might help you</a>. There are also plenty of 3rd party build videos on YouTube.</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='800' height='480' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhqyy1dn17E?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>\n<h2>First Cuts</h2>\n<p>The urge to cut something is overwhelming when you get the unit complete. However, be sure you have eye protection and plenty of ventilation. You should probably have a spray bottle of water and a fire extinguisher, too (you can see one of my fire extinguishers in the video below). Things do catch on fire under a laser, so be prepared. If you do get a little flame, try the water first since the extinguisher will make a huge mess.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/glasses.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img data-attachment-id=\"459055\" data-permalink=\"https://hackaday.com/2021/02/23/hands-on-with-the-ortur-laser-cutter/glasses-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/glasses.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"3672,2241\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"glasses\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/glasses.jpg?w=400\" data-large-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/glasses.jpg?w=800\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-459055\" src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/glasses.jpg?w=250\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"153\" srcset=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/glasses.jpg 3672w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/glasses.jpg?resize=250,153 250w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/glasses.jpg?resize=400,244 400w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/glasses.jpg?resize=800,488 800w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/glasses.jpg?resize=1536,937 1536w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/glasses.jpg?resize=2048,1250 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" /></a>The glasses that come with the cutter seem to be adequate and some people have tested them by firing the laser through them. However, I opted for some better-quality glasses. Your eyes are worth more than a few bucks you can save with cheap glasses.</p>\n<p>Be sure you have the latest firmware. My unit predated the January 2021 update and the fan did not run unless the laser was also running. I would guess this would shorten the laser diode&#8217;s life. With the updated firmware, there is smarter fan management along with some other fixes. The update is as simple as dragging and dropping a file, but for some reason, it only works under Windows. Linux sees the USB drive and will do the copy but it doesn&#8217;t stick. At least it didn&#8217;t brick the cutter.</p>\n<p>Regardless of firmware, before you can cut, you&#8217;ll need to set the focus correctly. If you are like me, you are probably thinking: &#8220;Focus? You don&#8217;t focus a laser.&#8221; Well, turns out you do focus a cheap laser.</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='800' height='480' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/KFGPXsOP40M?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=11&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>\n<h2>Focus is Everything</h2>\n<p>To get the required energy to the workpiece, the semiconductor laser passes through a lens that focuses the beam to &#8212; more or less &#8212; a point. That point is what does all the cutting or engraving. That means the piece you want to work with has to be at that focal point. After the lens, the beam will look like an hourglass and the further you are from the pinch in the hourglass, the less cutting you&#8217;ll do.</p>\n<p>The Ortur&#8217;s laser doesn&#8217;t move up and down but the lens can either screw in and out a few millimeters or push in and out, depending on which one you have. Once you have something under the cutter, you can put some black construction paper over it and use that to visualize the focus. The software you are using will have a button to turn the laser on at low power. Using the glasses will help reduce the spillover and you&#8217;ll be able to see the main part of the beam easily on the black paper.</p>\n<p>Some people use a USB microscope or other magnification to get the best focus. However, I didn&#8217;t like the stock method for focusing. The lens ring is hard to turn and even if you 3D print your own ring, it is awkward to spin the lens around. It also doesn&#8217;t afford you much range.</p>\n<p>Luckily, there are many 3D printed solutions to create a moving laser head on the Ortur. I&#8217;ll show you the one I&#8217;m using next time. For now, assume you are going to focus the lens yourself. That limits the height of things you can cut or engrave, too, although some people put the machine on blocks to make more room underneath. A tight focus will let you cut or engrave quicker and make the cut line finer, too. However, even if you are a little off, you can usually get some result. It is a good idea to tape your work down or clamp it so if you need to you can do a second pass without moving anything.</p>\n<p>There are different lenses you can get for the laser. The one the 15W machine comes with has a focal length of about 55 mm. However, there are other lenses &#8212; the G8 is popular &#8212; that have different focal lengths. Each lens has different characteristics as far as how tight they can focus and how many elements they have (more elements means less overall power).</p>\n<p>The power delivered to your part is a combination of the beam power, the quality of the focus, and the time spent. Even the time it takes for the laser to change direction can cause a deeper burn or cut which is why most software offers an overscan function that keeps the laser off and away from the cut line when it changes direction.</p>\n<p>If you are careful about focusing, you should be able to get a pretty good engraving on a piece of cardboard. Be sure to have something under it since you might cut through and leave a permanent mark. I mounted my cutter on a piece of plywood and I deliberately marked a grid on the board. I&#8217;ll tell you more about those additions next time.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, you deliberately want to defocus a little to get wider lines. [Geordie_h] talks about <a href=\"https://www.instructables.com/10-Tips-and-Tricks-for-Laser-Engraving-and-Cutting/\" target=\"_blank\">this trick, along with some other pro tips</a> that are aimed for a more commercial cutter, but still apply to the Ortur and other similar lasers.</p>\n<h2>Next Time</h2>\n<p>Speaking of next time, there&#8217;s a lot more to talk about. In addition to mounting the device and making the laser head move, I wanted to add air assist &#8212; something I&#8217;m still working on. This clear smoke from the cut as well as fine ash, allowing the laser to hit fresh material while cutting.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rocky.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img data-attachment-id=\"459152\" data-permalink=\"https://hackaday.com/2021/02/23/hands-on-with-the-ortur-laser-cutter/rocky-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rocky.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"3024,2696\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"rocky\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rocky.jpg?w=400\" data-large-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rocky.jpg?w=701\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-459152\" src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rocky.jpg?w=250\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"223\" srcset=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rocky.jpg 3024w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rocky.jpg?resize=250,223 250w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rocky.jpg?resize=400,357 400w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rocky.jpg?resize=701,625 701w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rocky.jpg?resize=1536,1369 1536w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rocky.jpg?resize=2048,1826 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" /></a>For some reason my machine will often stall on long cuts, and from reading the Internet, I&#8217;m not alone. Changing USB cables seemed to help. It may need a slightly beefier power supply or grounding on the frame. Then again, it could be power settings on my laptop. Time will tell. This has been particularly a problem when doing images that require a lot of time.

He likes using 2-liter soda bottles as lightweight tanks but their capacity is limited, so the nozzle can be a maximum of 1 mm in diameter if he wants to produce thrust for 30 seconds or longer using a turbine. Pelton turbines have been in use for a long time, especially for hydroelectric systems, and they use small diameter nozzles, so he decided to experiment with a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXEnXEfVBA8\" target=\"_blank\">pneumatic Pelton turbine</a>. (Video, embedded below.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2020/07/21/model-hydroelectric-plant-is-an-illuminating-educational-tool/\">Pelton wheels</a> are water wheels with specially designed buckets to efficiently extract energy from a high-velocity jet of water. [Tom] 3D printed several geared Pelton turbines and started doing bench tests with a propeller and a load cell to gather empirical data. With the help of high-speed video of the tests, he quickly realized that the turbine efficiency is highly dependent on the load. If the load is too small or too large, the moving air will not come to a complete standstill, and energy will be wasted. [Tom] also suspected that some moving air was escaping from the bucket, so he created a version that enclosed the buckets with a ring on the outer perimeter, which increased the peak thrust output by 65%. Compared to his <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2020/12/02/diaphragm-air-engine/\">diaphragm air engine</a> design, the peak thrust is higher, but the overall efficiency is less. [Tom] believes there is still room for improvement, so he plans to continue working on the Pelton turbine concept, with the hopes of building an air-powered model helicopter that can lift off.<span id=\"more-463696\"></span></p>\n<p>One comment that came up a few times with his piston engine designs is whether venting the air straight out the nozzle, without a turbine or engine in the way, would be a better option. [Tom] tested this in the bench, and the straight-through nozzle was four times less efficient than the turbine. The reason for this was addressed in the <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2020/12/02/diaphragm-air-engine/#comment-6299465\">comments</a> on our article on diaphragm air engine and discussed on the <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2020/12/04/hackaday-podcast-096-diaphragm-engine-diy-dish-washer-forgotten-soviet-computers-and-a-starlink-teardown/\">Hackaday podcast</a>. It&#8217;s an impedance matching problem, and an engine or turbine converts the small volume of high-velocity air into a large volume of low-velocity air.</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='800' height='480' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/zXEnXEfVBA8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://hackaday.com/2021/02/23/pelton-turbine-development-for-an-air-powered-model-helicopter/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>12</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">463696</post-id>\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-02-22-29.png\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-02-22-29.png\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">2021-02-22 (29)</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>\n"},"redirectURL":"","headersSize":-1,"bodySize":72272},"cache":{},"timings":{"blocked":-1,"dns":-1,"connect":-1,"ssl":-1,"send":1.250900000333786,"wait":132.15780000388622,"receive":30.870600000023842}},{"pageref":"Embarcadero","startedDateTime":"2021-02-23T16:57:27.569-07:00","time":422.45340000092983,"request":{"method":"GET","url":"https://www.geekwire.com/feed/","httpVersion":"HTTP/1.1","cookies":[],"headers":[{"name":"connection","value":"Keep-Alive"},{"name":"cookie","value":"country_code=US;

Photo)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Chris Young took the temperature on current kitchen innovation and decided the time was right to get back to the business of inventing devices to make home cooks smarter and food taste better.</p>\n<p>The longtime chef and onetime co-founder and CEO of high-tech Seattle cooking startup ChefSteps, Young is moving beyond the <em>sous vide</em> craze and <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2015/meet-joule-top-chefs-develop-high-tech-cooking-device-aiming-spark-revolution-kitchen/\">the &#8220;Joule&#8221; device he created</a> to capitalize on it. Young&#8217;s new company is called <a href=\"https://combustion.inc/\">Combustion Inc.</a> and the first product is a smart thermometer and timer for better gauging when food is perfectly cooked — no water needed, no meat submerged in a plastic bag.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you can really understand time and temperature and how to manage it, it&#8217;s like a cheat code for better cooking,&#8221; said Young, who previously collaborated with former Microsoft CTO Nathan Myhrvold, the Intellectual Ventures chief, on the epic <a href=\"http://modernistcuisine.com/\">Modernist Cuisine cookbook</a>. Young started ChefSteps in 2012 and it was <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2019/months-significant-layoffs-joule-cooking-device-maker-chefsteps-acquired-breville/\">acquired by kitchen appliance giant Breville Group</a> in July 2019.</p>\n<p>He had planned to take 2020 off, travel abroad with his family and not do anything. Then COVID-19 hit.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I got bored,&#8221; Young said. &#8220;And it turns out I like inventing things and I still love the kitchen.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He claims his new device is a smarter take on the wireless thermometer. Young has fit eight digital sensors into a sleek probe, designed to collect and calculate data from multiple points inside a cooking steak or flank of salmon. Gathering the key temperature at the surface of food and other points, and not just at the center where the tip of the probe rests, allows for a gradient reading. The device&#8217;s algorithmic tech can even deduce the size of a piece of meat and how evenly it&#8217;s cooking. Watch Young talk temperature in the YouTube Video below:</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe title=\"Your Oven is a Liar! Perfect your roast with surface temperature cooking.\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rxOJQjxKPiM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>A cook looking to make a medium rare steak at around 135 degrees Fahrenheit can set that temperature on the accompanying timer. The probe transmits its readings to the timer via Bluetooth, including when the steak should come off a grill and how long it should rest before it&#8217;s really done.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You tell us where you want to get to so we can sort of calculate the route,&#8221; Young said.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no need to fumble with a smartphone app or connect to the internet — although Combustion Inc. will have that tech, too.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We wanted to make this something that even if you&#8217;re kind of not into [Internet of Things] kitchenware, this is still incredibly useful and works just as an everyday thermometer,&#8221; Young said. &#8220;So many IoT devices require you to download an app and then you&#8217;ve got to pair it and then you&#8217;ve got to create an account. We ditched all of that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Young&#8217;s opinion of tech in the kitchen has evolved a bit from his days of <em>sous vide</em>, the technique of heating water to precise temperatures to cook immersed food evenly over extended periods of time. Having an app and an ecosystem was great to teach people about such a new method, and it was a necessary component for ChefSteps and the Joule.</p>\n<p>That experience of selling hundreds and hundreds of thousands of IoT devices and having tens of millions of meals cooked with them taught Young about which stuff gets in the way in the kitchen.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You already know how to use your grill. You already know how to use your frying pan. I don&#8217;t want you to have to download an app to stick a thermometer into a piece of food and figure out the temperature,&#8221; Young said.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_605747\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-605747\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full-width wp-image-605747\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/combustion-inc-steak-thermometer-and-timer-on-range-630x506.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/combustion-inc-steak-thermometer-and-timer-on-range-630x506.jpg 630w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/combustion-inc-steak-thermometer-and-timer-on-range-1260x1012.jpg 1260w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/combustion-inc-steak-thermometer-and-timer-on-range-768x617.jpg 768w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/combustion-inc-steak-thermometer-and-timer-on-range.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-605747\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Combustion Inc. Photo)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The Combustion Inc. thermometer won&#8217;t be alone in the market of smart devices trying to offer a better digital read on food temps. But Young said thermometers from Yummly and Meater, for instance, are failing to gather all the necessary information for a perfect meal.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to make a thermometer that nobody&#8217;s made before. We&#8217;re trying to make it a third smaller than all the other thermometers on the market that honestly feel a bit like jamming a pencil into your food,&#8221; Young said. &#8220;It&#8217;s got to survive the grill, it&#8217;s got to survive the dishwasher, the deep fryer. It sounds simple, but making electronics happy at 300 degrees Celsius is not easy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>About 20 globally distributed people are contributing to Combustion Inc., including a few employees, freelancers, people Young worked with at ChefSteps and others he wanted to work with in cooking or hardware design.</p>\n\n<p>The thermometer, which Young hopes to have in people&#8217;s hands by this summer, will sell through the Combustion website and interested buyers can sign up now to get notified. The device &#8220;won&#8217;t be the cheapest but won&#8217;t be ludicrously expensive,&#8221; Young said. &#8220;I do want this to be something that people feel is a good value.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The plan is to make other kitchen devices, but Young wasn&#8217;t sharing what types, except to say that there is a greater need for appliances that have a more software-centric approach — so they can potentially connect with his thermometer.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not easy to make it longterm with hardware, and ChefSteps wasn&#8217;t alone in running into trouble in the kitchen as it grew. <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2018/high-tech-cooking-startup-sansaire-shutting-ceasing-production-new-sous-vide-device/\">Seattle-based Sansaire shut down</a> during development of its own <em>sous vide</em> device in 2018.</p>\n<p>But, to borrow a cooking term, Young said his career innovating in the kitchen &#8220;wasn&#8217;t quite done.&#8221; He felt there was an opportunity to do some new things and take steps toward building back his community, making practical products that solve real problems.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In a certain sense, this product is a response to all of my friends who texted me going, &#8216;How should I cook this? Or what temperature for this?'&#8221; Young said. &#8220;Having something that guides you to getting a result, as good as I could get with 20 years of professional cooking experience — I think that&#8217;s kind of awesome.&#8221;</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>LinkedIn is down: &#8216;An error has occured&#8217; (Update: Resolved)</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.geekwire.com/2021/linkedin-error-occured/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 19:27:44 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Emil Protalinski]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[LinkedIn]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.geekwire.com/?p=605856</guid>\n\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img width=\"1260\" height=\"805\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/linkedin-outage-1260x805.png\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"LinkedIn is down outage\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/linkedin-outage-1260x805.png 1260w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/linkedin-outage-768x491.png 768w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/linkedin-outage-1536x981.png 1536w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/linkedin-outage-2048x1309.png 2048w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/linkedin-outage-630x403.png 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1260px) 100vw, 1260px\"><br>LinkedIn is down today with a generic &#8220;An error has occured&#8221; (sic) message.

The sample was from a patient who tested positive for the virus Jan. 29. Health officials have not been able to reach the patient through contact tracing, so the person&#8217;s travel history or other possible routes of exposure remain unknown.</p>\n<p>The state is currently decoding the genotype of about 2% of samples that are positive for COVID, which puts Washington in the top five states for sequencing, officials said. But it&#8217;s not enough.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I do not think we are doing enough surveillance that is representative,&#8221; Lindquist said. &#8220;And the other concern here is, is it representative of every community in Washington state?&#8221;</p>\n<p>The state is partnering with the UW, private labs in Seattle and the state public health lab in order to increase the rate of sequencing to capture 5% of COVID positive samples.</p>\n<p>As the variants spread, officials reminded people to continue taking steps to protect themselves and their communities, including wearing well-fitted masks, maintaining social distancing, washing hands and getting vaccinated. While the vaccines appear less effective against the South African strain, they can still prevent severe COVID cases, hospitalizations and deaths for patients with this strain and others, health officials said.</p>\n<p>“&#8221;Our vaccines that are currently authorized are incredibly effective against B.1.1.7, highly protective, and there&#8217;s no reason at this point to assume that the South African B.1.351 variant is going to become predominant,&#8221; said Dr. Jeff Duchin, the top health officer for Public Health – Seattle &amp; King County.</p>\n<p>In Washington, close to 13% of the population has received an initial dose of a COVID vaccine, and more than 5% are fully vaccinated.</p>\n<p>As with the rest of the country, the rate of COVID infections continues <a href=\"https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/DataDashboard\">declining in Washington state</a> and King County, which includes Seattle, Bellevue and Redmond. Given the steady decrease, the state has been loosening restrictions to allow people to dine and drink inside restaurants and bars, and has permitted reopening other in-person businesses. The entire state is currently operating under <a href=\"https://coronavirus.wa.gov/what-you-need-know/roadmap-recovery-metrics\">Phase Two</a> level restrictions.</p>\n<p>But given the increase in COVID variants of concern, state officials are reconsidering how to proceed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Should we take stock of where we are, look for these variants, before we make other decisions?&#8221; said Lindquist. &#8220;This is an ongoing discussion right now with the governor and the governor&#8217;s office, so more to come on that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Washington has not detected the presence of the Brazilian variant of COVID.</p>\n<p>There is increasing concern about a variant found in California in December, which is known as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/23/health/coronavirus-california-variant.html\">B.1.427/B.1.429</a>.

Easy prediction. Big congrats to you, Jeff.&#8221; [See full messages from Bezos and Blackburn below.]</p>\n<p>Much has changed in Amazon&#8217;s executive suite in Blackburn&#8217;s year away.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bezos <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-step-year-replaced-aws-chief-andy-jassy/\">this month announced plans to step down as CEO</a> in the third quarter of this year, shifting to a role as executive chairman, replaced as CEO by Andy Jassy, the longtime Amazon Web Services leader.</li>\n<li>Jeff Wilke, Amazon&#8217;s Worldwide Consumer CEO, <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2020/amazon-consumer-ceo-jeff-wilke-retire-next-year-will-replaced-operations-chief-dave-clark/\">announced in October</a> that he would be leaving in the first quarter of this year, replace by Dave Clark, the former head of worldwide operations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Blackburn showed his sense of humor in his message to the senior leadership team, or s-team, joking about one challenge that his departure will resolve.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The &#8216;too many Jeff’s&#8217; bug that’s been bothering many of you for two decades has been fixed!&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Over the years, we’ve always had multiple Jeff’s on s-team—Jeff Wilke, Jeff B, myself, and for a time Jeff Holden.  It’s actually how I became “jblack” to many of you and to employees across Amazon.  Wilke’s retirement meant one less Jeff, and today, I’m taking it down to just the original.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Like Wilke, Blackburn had been viewed previously as a potential successor to Bezos as CEO, not for continuity of first names, but for depth of experience. As Blackburn noted in memo, his association with Amazon started when he was a junior investment banker at Deutsche Bank, assigned to work on the Amazon IPO. During his more than 21 years of active work at the company, Blackburn led key businesses including Amazon&#8217;s third-party sales, Prime Video, Amazon Music and Amazon Advertising, working alongside Bezos on key business initiatives.</p>\n<p>In his message Tuesday, Blackburn recalled one pivotal moment: &#8220;In early 1998, I was told by the legendary CFO Joy Covey, that the website might become more than books… &#8216;you need to just come up here now, trust me&#8217;. Wow, you mean like Tapes &amp; CDs &amp; VHS? Done.&#8221;</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_605841\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-605841\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-605841 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_2063-1-630x420-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"420\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-605841\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Amazon exec Jeff Blackburn (right) talks with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell on the sidelines of a Monday Night Football game in Seattle in December 2019. (GeekWire Photo / Taylor Soper)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>He also navigated public challenges along the way. In 2018, Blackburn faced criticism from Amazon Studios employees for what they reportedly perceived as him glossing over the circumstances of studio chief Roy Price&#8217;s resignation following a sexual harassment allegation against Price. Speaking with employees, Blackburn &#8220;sought to cast the situation as a fresh start for an organization already undertaking a bold new strategy,&#8221; but his message &#8220;frustrated some employees,&#8221; news publication The Information <a href=\"http://thein.fo/2260aed9a8cce6a8\">reported at the time</a>.</p>\n<p>One effect of Blackburn&#8217;s departure will be to give Jassy a chance to reshape more of the Amazon leadership team as he assumes the reins as CEO later this year. A key announcement that has yet to be made by the company is who will succeed Jassy as CEO of AWS, the company&#8217;s fast-growing and profitable cloud division.</p>\n<p>In his message to the leadership team, Blackburn said he hopes that he pushed them and Amazon &#8220;to be even more bold, see around corners, think big,&#8221; during his tenure. &#8220;With the core business in as strong a position as it’s ever been, I know that’s what customers will want from you over the next decade.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Here is Blackburn&#8217;s message, followed by Bezos&#8217; reply, as posted to Amazon&#8217;s intranet.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Steam: I have an important update for you all, one I know you’ve been waiting on for a long time. The “too many Jeff’s” bug that’s been bothering many of you for two decades has been fixed! Over the years, we’ve always had multiple Jeff’s on s-team—Jeff Wilke, Jeff B, myself, and for a time Jeff Holden. It’s actually how I became “jblack” to many of you and to employees across Amazon. Wilke’s retirement meant one less Jeff, and today, I’m taking it down to just the original.</p>\n<p>I am officially leaving Amazon today. In late 1996, I was a junior investment banker at Deutsche Bank, assigned to a potential Amazon IPO project. I did the excel models, wrote chunks of the AMZN IPO prospectus, etc. One of the things that sticks with me to this day is that I was the one who carried all the team’s heavier bags during our three weeks of global travel. There was no Zoom or Chime, so it was quite a grueling process back then.</p>\n<p>In early 1998, I was told by the legendary CFO Joy Covey, that the website might become more than books… “you need to just come up here now, trust me”. Wow, you mean like Tapes &amp; CDs &amp; VHS? Done.</p>\n<p>I joined Amazon full-time soon thereafter. I would do a lot of building with you all – 3P marketplace, M&amp;A and BusDev teams, A9, Advertising, Amazon Music, Prime Video, Amazon Studios. During my 22 years, I’d like to think I never stopped helping carry those heavier bags. The newer initiatives, the ones that took extra courage and long-term thinking by our team. And I hope that, on the margin, I pushed s-team and Amazon to be even more bold, see around corners, think big. With the core business in as strong a position as it’s ever been, I know that’s what customers will want from you over the next decade.</p>\n<p>Terrific new s-team leaders have stepped into these big roles and are continuing to build and boldly invent. I admire and particularly commend your leadership for the past 11 months: watching the company execute during COVID has been astonishing – your teams deliver Amazon’s best when the best is most needed.</p>\n<p>I want to thank you all for your friendship, teamwork, and support. What an amazing 22 years it has been together – I will cherish it, forever. I’m not retiring and will have news on what’s next for me soon.</p>\n<p>Of course, today, I am formally giving up “jblack@”. I have just one request—that I forever stay “jblack” in the halls of Amazon. It’d be an honor,</p>\n<p>-Jeff</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>It was a lucky day for us when you got assigned to that IPO roadshow. Watching you as that junior investment banker, it was easy to see your wicked smarts — fully on display. But who knew you’d be so driven by a relentless urge to invent and pioneer? From marketplace and advertising to the launch of Prime Video and Amazon Studios, you’ve been a builder. And you’ve helped all of us in everything — not just the things you directly led. You have judgment and your viewpoint is never redundant. When you talk, I find myself leaning in and listening carefully — always.</p>\n<p>Thank you for more than two decades of leadership. For pushing us all to keep exploring. For carrying all of those bags.</p>\n<p>Though it’s not quite ready to be shared, jblack has kept me in the loop on his next chapter, and I can assure you it’s a very exciting one! I predict that Jeff will be every bit as amazing in his new role as he’s been in all his roles at Amazon. Easy prediction. Big congrats to you, Jeff.</p>\n<p>Your friend always,</p>\n<p>Jeff</p></blockquote>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>&#8216;Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2&#8217; publisher removes Seattle&#8217;s Hardsuit Labs as developer</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.geekwire.com/2021/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-publisher-removes-seattles-hardsuit-labs-developer/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 17:42:42 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Thomas Wilde]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Games]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[hardsuit labs]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[vampire: the masquerade]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.geekwire.com/?p=605762</guid>\n\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img width=\"630\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Vampire-the-Masquerade-Bloodlines-2.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"><br>The Swedish publisher of the upcoming Seattle-set horror RPG, Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2, has opted to remove Seattle&#8217;s Hardsuit Labs as the project&#8217;s lead developer.

It&#8217;s also well-known to gaming enthusiasts for its lineup of notoriously complex &#8220;grand strategy&#8221; games, such as last year&#8217;s <i>Crusader Kings III</i> and <i>Empire of Sin</i>.</p>\n<p>Like several other big gaming companies in the last few weeks, Paradox&#8217;s year-end report tells a familiar story. It calls 2020 the &#8220;best year in Paradox&#8217;s history,&#8221; with record revenue and a huge influx of new players, but a year later, it&#8217;s turned out to be a double-edged sword.</p>\n<p>The same pandemic lockdowns that created a huge pool of bored new customers for Paradox have also affected its studio management structure, which has now forced it to rearrange its production schedule. Internally, Paradox has opted to cancel at least one unannounced project, as well as postpone several of its &#8220;planned but not communicated&#8221; upcoming releases.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have also decided that Hardsuit Labs will no longer be leading the development of <i>Bloodlines 2,&#8221; </i>wrote Ebba Ljungerud, Paradox CEO, in the report, &#8220;and we have started a collaboration with a new studio partner to finish work on the game.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Paradox later confirmed the announcement via the official <i>Bloodlines 2 </i>Twitter account, with a promise of more details following &#8220;as soon as we can.&#8221; Hardsuit Labs itself has yet to comment.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In case you are unable to access the website, you can read the Bloodlines 2 Development Update right here. <a href=\"https://t.co/kdTp5gpBJe\">pic.twitter.com/kdTp5gpBJe</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Vampire: The Masquerade &#8211; Bloodlines 2 (@VtM_Bloodlines) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VtM_Bloodlines/status/1364124564620517378?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 23, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Formed in 2015 as Builder Box Games, by veterans of the closed Zombie Studios, Hardsuit’s previous project was the cyberpunk FPS <a href=\"https://www.hardsuitlabs.com/blacklight/\"><em>Blacklight: Retribution</em></a>.</p>\n<p><i>Vampire: The Masquerade </i>was originally a tabletop game, first published in 1991 by the Atlanta-based company White Wolf. <i>Vampire </i>was the flagship game in a shared universe called the World of Darkness, a bleak Gothic spin on the real world where many supernatural monsters were very real and barely hidden from ordinary humanity.</p>\n<p>While several video games got made out of the World of Darkness over the years, the most popular turned out to be 2004&#8217;s <i>Bloodlines</i>, an open-ended RPG set in a particularly grimy version of Los Angeles. While <i>Bloodlines </i>shipped in an unfinished state and was up against unbeatable competition when it launched, it slowly acquired fans over the years until it turned into a genuine cult favorite.</p>\n<p><em>Bloodlines 2 </em>was <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2019/set-developed-seattle-new-sequel-cult-classic-vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-will-debut-2020/\">announced back in March 2019</a>, with several of the original <em>Bloodlines</em>&#8216;s writers returning to work on it alongside Hardsuit Labs. It immediately hit the top of many enthusiasts&#8217; most-anticipated lists, though rumors have persisted since last year of behind-the-scenes problems with its development.</p>\n<p>Paradox acquired White Wolf from its previous owners, <em>Eve Online </em>developer CCP, in 2015, and gained the rights to all the games in the World of Darkness along with it. After a <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/16/18098929/white-wolf-controversy-paradox-interactive-new-ceo\">notoriously botched 2018 attempt</a> by White Wolf to revive the original tabletop setting, Paradox has instead opted to commission several video games based on the World of Darkness, including the recent release <i>Werewolf: The Apocalypse – Earthblood</i>. For some reason, both <em>Earthblood </em>and <em>Bloodlines 2 </em>are explicitly set in Washington state.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>GeekWire is turning 10: Seeking memorabilia from the past decade of Seattle and Pacific NW tech</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.geekwire.com/2021/geekwire-turning-10-seeking-memorabilia-past-decade-seattle-pacific-nw-tech/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 16:00:18 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Cara Kuhlman]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Community]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[BCRA]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[GeekWire Update]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.geekwire.com/?p=605617</guid>\n\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img width=\"1260\" height=\"841\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Geekwire-21.02_15-1260x841.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Geekwire-21.02_15-1260x841.jpg 1260w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Geekwire-21.02_15-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Geekwire-21.02_15-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Geekwire-21.02_15-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Geekwire-21.02_15-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1260px) 100vw, 1260px\"><br>Help us celebrate a decade of tech news coverage in Seattle!

It also requires 50 Mbps of bandwidth and a 5 Ghz WiFi 6 internet connection. According to Gibson, the PlutoSphere PC client, upon release, will enable compatibility with other headsets such as the HTC Vive or Valve Index.</p>\n<p>In a move that Gibson calls &#8220;[breaking] down the walled garden,&#8221; PlutoSphere also allows users to access their game libraries on the Steam and Epic digital storefronts, alongside the ability to install and run any OpenVR or OpenXR application.</p>\n<p>Combined with the PlutoSphere&#8217;s support for Oculus, it sounds like Pluto is working to create an all-in-one solution for PC VR players, many of whom might have multiple games scattered across several different storefronts. The company plans to add more features to PlutoSphere post-launch, such as a persistent social layer and support for augmented reality apps.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_159657\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-159657\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-159657 size-medium\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/plutovr-team-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/plutovr-team-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/plutovr-team-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/plutovr-team-100x100.jpg 100w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/plutovr-team-620x619.jpg 620w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/plutovr-team.jpg 667w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-159657\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Pluto VR founding team.

Its other projects include an <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/389980/Pluto/\">eponymous communication service</a> for VR environments, and the recently-debuted <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/685110/Metachromium/\">Metachromium</a>, a spatial browser that lets you open web browser apps as an overlay running on top of any other VR game.</p>\n<p>Since its founding, Pluto VR&#8217;s staff has grown to 22 people. Following a <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2017/pluto-vr-raises-14m-to-build-out-virtual-reality-communication-platform/\">Series A funding round in 2017</a>, Pluto has been working on R&amp;D, infrastructure development, and contributing to projects such as OpenXR and WebXR. It plans to pursue a Series B round later this year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;PlutoSphere is the result of us working in spatial computing, participating in open standards, and working to develop a more open ecosystem,&#8221; Gibson said to GeekWire. &#8220;Our aim with PlutoSphere is to open the doors of closed platforms and offload computing and rendering to the cloud or edge, to be able to run a wider range of games and applications alongside each other.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gibson noted that VR and AR are still mostly locked in a &#8220;single app&#8221; world.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You run a single app and that provides your entire experience,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There is a growing need to be able to have multiple apps running at the same time, just like you have on your computer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In a piece he <a href=\"https://forestgibson.medium.com/multi-app-the-next-evolution-in-spatial-computing-364fa4494244\">published on Medium last month</a>, Gibson describes multi-app as the future of spatial computing.</p>\n<p>While sales of virtual reality headsets and other gear have steadily climbed over the course of the last year, it still only makes up a tiny bit of the overall games industry, kept visible by a relative handful of extremely enthusiastic developers and players.</p>\n<p>More than 3 million players picked up VR headsets in 2020, <a href=\"https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/GeorgeJijiashvili/20201130/374385/64_million_consumer_VR_headsets_will_be_sold_in_2020_with_content_spending_surpassing_1bn_mark_Omdias_new_research_shows.php\">spending $1.1 billion on games and hardware</a>. It sounds like a lot, but the overall games industry ballooned to <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/videogames-are-a-bigger-industry-than-sports-and-movies-combined-thanks-to-the-pandemic-11608654990\">$180 billion in spending in 2020</a>. VR in 2021 is and remains an exciting, well-publicized, growing, but ultimately narrow niche, despite the efforts of <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2020/review-half-life-alyx-return-form-valve-must-virtual-reality-fans/\">major players such as Valve</a>.</p>\n<p>If the PlutoSphere works as advertised, that would lower the cost of getting into VR to the point where it&#8217;s roughly competitive with picking up a new Nintendo Switch. In theory, this would do a lot to remove two of the major barriers—  cost and space — that naturally limit VR&#8217;s appeal to the wider consumer market.</p>\n<p>In conjunction with inexpensive newer standalone headsets like the Oculus Go, it&#8217;s a potential big step forward toward getting VR into the homes of more interested consumers. However, it&#8217;s also a game streaming service, which means residential internet and other infrastructure roadblocks could be a serious issue in the U.S. market.</p>\n<p>Pluto is scheduled to open reservations for the PlutoSphere service for interested buyers on Tuesday morning.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>SoundCommerce raises $15M to help online retailers &#8216;think and act like Amazon&#8217;</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.geekwire.com/2021/soundcommerce-raises-15m-help-online-retailers-think-act-like-amazon/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 14:00:03 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Taylor Soper]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Startups]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[e-commerce]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Funding]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[fundraising]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[sound commerce]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Venture capital]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.geekwire.com/?p=605641</guid>\n\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img width=\"1260\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-18-at-4.37.52-PM-1260x706.png\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-18-at-4.37.52-PM-1260x706.png 1260w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-18-at-4.37.52-PM-768x431.png 768w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-18-at-4.37.52-PM-1536x861.png 1536w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-18-at-4.37.52-PM-2048x1148.png 2048w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-18-at-4.37.52-PM-630x353.png 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1260px) 100vw, 1260px\"><br>Another Seattle e-commerce logistics startup is raising more cash.

That was before the pandemic, which forced the company to <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2020/riveter-closes-9-co-working-spaces-questions-loom-future-physical-offices/\">close all nine of its locations last year</a>.</p>\n<p>She is not named in Amazon’s civil suit. The Riveter itself is not involved or mentioned by name in any of the legal proceedings. Lawyers for the Nelsons say the government has not identified Amy Nelson as a target or subject of the FBI investigation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Opposition_Motion_Forfeiture.pdf\">The Feb. 17 filing</a> formally opposes a motion by the federal government to delay, for six months, court proceedings related to the seizure of the Nelsons’ bank accounts. Those seizures now amount to $633,916 after deducting money set aside for lawyers’ fees in the case.</p>\n<p>“Based on the Government’s own representations, $475,892 of that money are not even purported fraud proceeds, but were seized because of potential commingling with money that the Nelsons earned from their jobs or investments,” lawyers for the Nelsons say in the filing.</p>\n<p>Citing a delay in grand jury proceedings due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department of Justice <a href=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Joint-motion-to-stay.pdf\">asked the court on Feb. 3</a> to pause the civil forfeiture case. Justice Department attorneys referenced a sealed declaration in which an FBI special agent indicated that the normal process of discovery in the forfeiture case “would have an adverse impact on a pending criminal investigation,” as the DOJ filing explained it, by publicly disclosing sensitive information.</p>\n<p>“No indictment has been issued at this point, but the case is actively proceeding,” lawyers for the government wrote in the filing,” adding that “not all who may be implicated are aware that they are subjects of the investigation.”</p>\n<p>In response, lawyers for Amy and Carl Nelson say in the filing that key details of the case have already been made public through Amazon’s lawsuit and news reports, citing <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2021/former-aws-real-estate-managers-accused-taking-millions-kickbacks-challenge-amazons-motives-amid-fbi-investigation/\">reporting for GeekWire by journalist Levi Pulkkinen</a>. The volume of publicly available information renders the government’s concerns largely moot or easily handled with customary redactions, they assert.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We look forward to the opportunity to litigate the case and seek the return of the Nelsons&#8217; money,&#8221; said Suneeta Hazra, a lawyer for the Nelsons, a partner at law firm Arnold &amp; Porter in Denver and former chief of the Criminal Division in the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office for the District of Colorado.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the filing says, the seizure of the funds is having “a profound effect” on the Nelsons. They sold their Seattle home for $1.3 million in January, according to King County property records. They have been unable to pay their 2019 income tax bill, because the $125,000 they set aside for the purpose has been seized, according to the court filing.</p>\n<p>In addition, the filing notes that “the extensive publicity regarding the proceedings involving Amazon and this forfeiture complaint has compromised the ability of both Mr. and Mrs. Nelson to earn a living and care for their large, young family.”</p>\n<p>Rather than requesting a stay after starting the forfeiture case, they say, the government could have originally asked for a continuance, giving it more time to file the case in the first place.</p>\n<p>“Here, it chose not to do so despite the incredibly harmful effect its naming of Amy Nelson in the caption of the complaint would have on her business and reputation,” the filing says. “Having made that choice, without consulting with the Nelsons’ attorneys or Mr. Nelson, the relief the Government seeks would give Mrs. Nelson no avenue to obtain even a scintilla of information to which she is entitled to under the discovery rules.”</p>\n<p>The filing also provides details on how the criminal investigation has unfolded. It says Carl Nelson first learned about it on April 2, 2020, “when FBI agents arrived unannounced at his house in Seattle, in the middle of the pandemic, and informed him that he is the target of a federal investigation in the Eastern District of Virginia.”</p>\n<p>The funds were seized on May 22, 2020, from six of the Nelsons’ bank accounts, the filing says.</p>\n<p>“On June 5, the FBI again showed up unannounced to search the Nelsons’ home in the presence of Mr. Nelson, his wife, and their four daughters — then ages 5, 3, 2, and 9 months,” the filing says. “They stayed for less than an hour, during which they seized Mr. Nelson’s mobile phone, laptop, and various paper documents.”</p>\n<p>For friends of Amy Nelson and members of the Seattle tech community who have closely followed her entrepreneurial journey, details of the investigation and suit against her husband have shed new light on what she has been experiencing in the past year, helping to fill in the gaps left by social media posts in which she alluded to the legal entanglements.</p>\n<p>“There is no advice I could have given myself a year ago because, like, you couldn’t make this year up,” she wrote in an Instagram post in December. “Your business has an amazing team of 100 and is growing 20% month over month? You own the home you worked years to buy? Your husband has a successful consulting business? Your kids go to school? You are not currently mired in legal hell? It’s going to look really different in 12 months.

His attorneys claim Amazon violated his contract by suing him in federal court in Virginia rather than in Washington state court, the venue set in the agreement.</p>\n<p>The latest filing by the Nelsons’ lawyers says that Amazon initially based its civil suit on an employment agreement signed by another Amazon employee, not Nelson, with “an entirely different employment contract with different terms regarding outside income.”</p>\n<p>Amazon has since updated its complaint with the correct contract, but lawyers for the Nelsons assert in the filing that the company nonetheless “predicated a substantial portion of those initial allegations against Mr. Nelson — and presumably all of its initial discussions with the Government — on an employment contract that had nothing to (do) with him.”</p>\n<p>The filing also offers a glimpse of Carl Nelson’s legal defense, noting that “Amazon has suggested Mr. Nelson’s actions constituted an undisclosed conflict of interest, which the Supreme Court has explicitly held does not qualify as <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1346\">honest services fraud</a>,” which federal law defines as “a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.”</p>\n<p>In its earlier filing in the forfeiture case, the government said that the seized funds represented proceeds not just from alleged honest-services wire fraud or a conspiracy to commit fraud, but also from alleged money laundering or unlawful monetary transactions.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>NASA releases jaw-dropping video and audio from Mars, with an assist from AWS</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.geekwire.com/2021/nasa-releases-jaw-dropping-video-audio-mars-assist-aws/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 00:04:30 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Alan Boyle]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Space]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[2020 Mars rover]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Amazon Web Services]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[AWS]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[mars]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[NASA]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[NASA JPL]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Perseverance rover]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.geekwire.com/?p=605636</guid>\n\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img width=\"1190\" height=\"799\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210222-panorama3.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"Mars Perseverance panorama\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210222-panorama3.jpg 1190w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210222-panorama3-768x516.jpg 768w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210222-panorama3-630x423.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1190px) 100vw, 1190px\"><br>For the first time ever, NASA has captured video of a rover landing on the surface of Mars, plus audio of the wind whistling past it after the landing — and Amazon Web Services is playing a key role in making all those gigabytes of goodness available to the world.

Another camera looked down from the &#8220;Sky Crane&#8221; descent stage to watch the rover&#8217;s touchdown. Meanwhile, cameras on the rover looked up at the Sky Crane and looked down and out to survey its surroundings.</p>\n<p>All those perspectives were put together in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4czjS9h4Fpg\">three-minute video</a> that documented the milestones of the descent, from the time the parachute popped open to the rover&#8217;s dusty touchdown.

But the way they would go about solving engineering problems in space — where “you never have enough mass, you never have enough volume, you never have enough power and you never have enough data, and your environment is trying to kill you” — led Voorhees and his team to think they could tackle engineering challenges in other extreme environments.</p>\n<p>“We thought that (process) was portable to other problems,” he said. “We didn’t know where that adventure was going to take us.”</p>\n<p>This particular path brought the space company down to Earth.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_538306\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-538306\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full-width wp-image-538306\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/191217-truck-630x354.png\" alt=\"Hydrogen-powered truck\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/191217-truck-630x354.png 630w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/191217-truck.png 667w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-538306\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A rendering shows the components of a hydrogen-fueled mine haul truck. (Anglo American Graphic)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Ultra-class haul trucks are a far different type of vehicle than the Mars rovers the First Mode teams have worked on in the past.</p>\n<p>For starters, they’re as tall as a three-story building, and they weigh “about a million pounds,” Voorhees said. They’re built to carry up to 300 metric tons of ore from open-pit mines to nearby processing plants. Anglo-American operates fleets of these dinosaur-sized Tonka trucks at its mines, each one burning thousands of gallons of diesel to fuel the 2-megawatt on-board generator that powers each vehicle.</p>\n<p>“It’s a lot of diesel and you have dozens of machines running continuously on site,” he said. Taking just one of the haulers out of operation will eliminate about as much in carbon emissions as 10,000 diesel-powered automobiles.</p>\n<p>First Mode is designing and building a hydrogen fuel cell generator to do just that.</p>\n\n<p>Fuel cells combine hydrogen and oxygen in an electrochemical process that generates electricity. The only byproduct is water vapor. Such fuel cells are used now to power forklifts and buses; Toyota, Honda and Hyundai are or will be in the market this year with hydrogen-powered automobiles.</p>\n<p>There are two major differences between those fuel cells and what First Mode is doing. One is scale, Voorhees said. The haulers’ 2-megawatt generators are “a utility-grade power and utility problem that happens to be an off-road vehicle,” he said.</p>\n<p>And the other is that it’s a retrofit project. To succeed, First Mode must fit the generator into the available space and “get it converted in a way that creates a good marriage between the existing platform and this new source of energy,” Voorhees said.</p>\n<p>It’s a much different challenge for a bunch of space designers, he said.</p>\n<p>“I’ve worked on designing vehicles for Mars and I think (mining) is worse,” he said. “The constraints are all different and the environment is not the same, but the approach is similar.”</p>\n<p>The goal, he said, is to finish assembly of the generator in Seattle within the next few weeks, test it and then ship it to South Africa for installation and field testing starting in June. With field test results in hand, First Mode will then modify its design for follow-on haulers.</p>\n<p>They’ll also start looking for other customers who could use large-scale, clean-power generators that need to move around, Voorhees said.</p>\n<p>“The haul-truck application is not the low-hanging fruit,” he said. “If we can make it work in that environment, we can make it work anywhere, and there are a bunch of industrial applications that could benefit.”</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Another unicorn in Seattle: Enterprise sales startup Highspot raises $200M round at a $2.3B valuation</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.geekwire.com/2021/another-unicorn-seattle-enterprise-sales-startup-highspot-raises-200m-round-2-3b-valuation/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2021 15:50:46 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Taylor Soper]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Startups]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Funding]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[fundraising]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[HighSpot]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Venture capital]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.geekwire.com/?p=605568</guid>\n\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img width=\"1260\" height=\"846\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CurrentHQMeetingRoom-1260x846.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CurrentHQMeetingRoom-1260x846.jpg 1260w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CurrentHQMeetingRoom-768x516.jpg 768w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CurrentHQMeetingRoom-630x423.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1260px) 100vw, 1260px\"><br>Highspot has joined the growing list of billion-dollar startups sprouting up in the Seattle area.

The company is benefiting from a strong U.S. housing market that gained nearly $2.5 trillion in value last year, the most since 2005, <a href=\"http://zillow.mediaroom.com/2021-01-26-2020-U-S-Housing-Market-Gains-Were-Biggest-in-15-Years\">according to a Zillow analysis</a>.</p>\n<p>The company’s annual revenue last year increased 22% from 2019, while overall traffic hit a record 9.6 billion page views, up 19%.</p>\n<p>Daimler joined Zillow in 2012 and previously was senior vice president of the company&#8217;s Premier Agent business, which saw revenues climb 35% to $314 million in the fourth quarter. She will report to Wacksman and lead an &#8220;integrated product team for buyers and sellers,&#8221; and continue overseeing Premier Agent.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Susan is an important and deeply influential voice in the real estate industry and a highly respected leader within the company, for good reason,&#8221; Barton said.</p>\n<p>Prior to starting at Zillow in 2009, Wacksman spent three years at Microsoft in marketing and product management at Xbox.

Jeff Bezos now joins <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_E._Boeing\">Bill Boeing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Who-We-Are/General-Information/Leadership/Executive-Leadership-Team/Bill-Gates\">Bill Gates</a> as the three most significant entrepreneurs in Seattle history. Together, they have established our region as an inventive powerhouse, spearheading entirely new spaces.</p>\n<p>The companies that the &#8220;three B&#8217;s&#8221; developed are world-beaters: Boeing, Microsoft and Amazon. And they remain at the very heart of the Pacific Northwest economy. They all offer compelling products that define markets and change the lives of customers. Flying a Boeing plane, working on a device that uses Microsoft software, or having products delivered through Amazon are simply part of the fabric of the customer&#8217;s life all across the world today.</p>\n<p>Each of the companies is exceptionally profitable, and all three are world-class employers. In 2020, Amazon&#8217;s revenue was $386 billion, Microsoft&#8217;s revenue was $143 billion and Boeing&#8217;s was $58.2 billion (although, it was as high as $100 billion a few years back).</p>\n<p>And it all happened here in Seattle.</p>\n<h4>Innovation</h4>\n<p>Each of these innovators launched products that were regarded as absolutely impossible. Nobody thought we could fly. Even after the Wright Brothers demonstrated it, there was little evidence that we would have a worldwide network of travel using airplanes. Yet, Bill Boeing, a timber merchant, found a way to leverage his experience to not just build the first commercial airplanes, but spawn an entire industry.</p>\n<p>Very few people saw the future of personal computers. The early efforts were viewed as ultra-technical. Yet, Microsoft-powered computers now run the most complex organizations in the world. And, nobody thought that the Internet could be leveraged to order anything we can imagine for rapid delivery. And yet, Amazon has become the machine that translates customer clicks to brown cardboard boxes that mysteriously arrive on doorsteps.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_457733\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-457733\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-457733 size-full-width\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/20181021_Renton_29-630x420.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"420\" srcset=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/20181021_Renton_29-630x420.jpg 630w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/20181021_Renton_29-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/20181021_Renton_29-1260x840.jpg 1260w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/20181021_Renton_29.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-457733\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Unfinished 737s outside the Boeing plant in Renton. (GeekWire Photo / Kevin Lisota)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Bill Boeing and Jeff Bezos both migrated to this region. Boeing was from Detroit. Bezos was born in New Mexico, and later worked on Wall Street. Bill Gates is a native. They all recognized the regional advantages: physical infrastructure, technical workforce and a receptive business environment, to name a few.</p>\n<p>All three of these entrepreneurs found ways to leverage their initial success to build diverse portfolios of profitable businesses.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.historylink.org/File/5368#\">conglomerate that Bill Boeing built</a> included United Airlines (transportation), Pratt and Whitney (aircraft engines) and, of course, the Boeing Co. (airplanes). Microsoft is now a fundamentally global corporation with diverse software and hardware (e.g., Xbox, HoloLens) operations.</p>\n<p>Similarly, after starting out as an online bookstore, Amazon has grown into a company with a plethora of dimensions. Amazon now owns a fleet of planes, <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-receives-fcc-approval-for-project-kuiper-satellite-constellation\">satellites</a> and drones. In many ways, Amazon has already become a transportation conglomerate.</p>\n<p>In contrast to its relatively modest initial ambitions, the breadth of Amazon&#8217;s current operations could not have been envisioned on day one. Amazon as it stands right now has a few key pillars: online retail, third-party fulfillment/logistics, advertising, and the AWS cloud platform, which, along with Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, is redefining the very nature of computing.</p>\n<p>Fundamentally, all three companies democratized major industries. Bill Boeing envisioned a commercial airline where everybody could fly. Bill Gates imagined computers not occupying entire buildings, but helping the average person be more productive. Bezos democratized the world of online shopping by putting the customer in charge rather than traditional stores.</p>\n<h4>Culture</h4>\n<p>All three business leaders also built powerful cultures capable of sustaining or accelerating their original vision.</p>\n<p>Bill Boeing had a sign on his wall that said, “2329 Hippocrates said: 1. There is no authority except facts. 2. Facts are obtained by accurate observation. 3. Deductions are to be made only from facts. 4. Experience has proved the truth of these rules.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bill Gates made famous his “think weeks” where he took a personal retreat, reading memos written by employees from all over the company.</p>\n<p>Jeff Bezos created a work culture where employees write six-page memos and time is spent first reading the memo by the group. He advocated making a few high-quality decisions, obsessing over customers, not paying too close attention to the stock market and embracing failure.</p>\n<h4>Antitrust</h4>\n<p>All &#8220;three B&#8217;s&#8221; went through antitrust investigations. The scale of the organizations that they built were so strikingly immense that they attracted the attention of regulators.</p>\n<p>Bill Boeing’s company was broken up into three separate entities: the Boeing company, Pratt and Whitney and United Airlines. Microsoft went through a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.\">hard-fought antitrust action around linking the operating system and the web browser.</a> And, Jeff Bezos has had <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2020/heres-jeff-bezos-revealed-antitrust-case-amazon-unwieldy-tech-hearing/\">his share of antitrust attention, particularly focused on third-party sellers.</a></p>\n<h4>Philanthropy and Societal Impact</h4>\n<p>In addition to this immense scale of innovation within Amazon, the reality is that Bezos is now bigger than Amazon itself. He owns the prestigious Washington Post, the standard-bearer in American journalism. And, his space company, <a href=\"https://www.blueorigin.com/\">Blue Origin</a>, is focused on sub-orbital flight. I have a feeling that he will simply not stop here. By stepping down as CEO, Bezos has acquired for himself the flexibility to innovate even further. He can invest or start new ventures that have immense potential.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_479751\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-479751\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full-width wp-image-479751\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/20190129_Bill_Gates_169-630x420.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"420\" srcset=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/20190129_Bill_Gates_169-630x420.jpg 630w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/20190129_Bill_Gates_169-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/20190129_Bill_Gates_169-1260x840.jpg 1260w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/20190129_Bill_Gates_169.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-479751\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates (GeekWire Photo / Kevin Lisota)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>All &#8220;three B&#8217;s&#8221; got involved in philanthropy in meaningful ways. Bill Gates is clearly the leader of the three with his <a href=\"https://www.gatesfoundation.org/\">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation,</a> which has now become the largest non-profit in the world. Jeff Bezos arrived at philanthropy late. Arguably, he really only started to even think about it in the last decade or so, and many argued that <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2016/corporate-scrooge-no-amazons-philanthropy-reshapes-reputation-point/\">he and Amazon simply had not done enough</a>. It is impressive to see the focus on <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazons-new-2b-fund-aims-boost-affordable-housing-arlington-nashville-seattle-areas/\">homelessness</a> and <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-invests-startup-producing-net-zero-carbon-fuels-transportation/\">sustainability</a>, in particular.</p>\n<p>As with any other philanthropic effort, there are detractors and critics. But, there is no doubt that these efforts have made a big difference in many lives. Boeing has been a strong supporter of various community organizations ranging from health and human services to education. The consistency of its support has been particularly appreciated. But, there is valid criticism about <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeowners-find-records-still-hold-blot-of-racism/\">Bill Boeing’s role in housing covenants.</a></p>\n<p>Certainly, Jeff Bezos paid attention to the political climate as he made his decision to step down. There is momentum for the <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2020/amazon-avoided-unions-25-years-heres-labor-leaders-think-soon-change/\">unionization of Amazon warehouse workers</a>, including an <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/09/tech/amazon-warehouse-union-election/index.html\">imminent vote</a>. Democratic Presidential candidates also made the case that Amazon does not pay its fair share of taxes. In a major departure, the company reported paying $1.8 billion in taxes in 2020 <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-u-s-tax-costs-jumped-in-2020-it-likely-would-pay-even-more-under-biden-plan-11612521002\">according to the Wall Street Journal</a> and will be expecting to pay even more in the coming years in a Biden-Harris administration.</p>\n<p>The changing political climate may have further exacerbated the pressure on the company in terms of affordable housing, environmental sustainability and support for unions. It remains to be seen if Amazon will deal with these issues by automating even further or supporting its people. Many are seeing the hire of Jassy as being supportive of the automation route, but that is just speculation at this point.</p>\n<h4>Succession</h4>\n<p>The decision to step down is always tricky for a founder. Bill Boeing left the company after the antitrust action and airplane designerClaire Egtvedt took over as CEO. Bill Gates left Microsoft to his long-time colleague, Steve Ballmer, who has since been succeeded by Satya Nadella as CEO. Now, Jeff Bezos has left the reins to Andy Jassy.</p>\n<p>There is a pattern of handing over the reins to a long-standing employee and Amazon is no different. In the case of Microsoft, Ballmer changed the tenor of the company from a technology-centric corporation to a sales-driven entity. Given the technical work of Andy Jassy, he is likely to drive a future that places AWS in a more central position.</p>\n<p>Overall, there must be something in the water here in Seattle. We have had a tremendous track record in building large-scale innovative companies. Here&#8217;s to the &#8220;three B&#8217;s&#8221; and their immense contributions to society and the world. I am sure the next generation of diverse innovators will be ready to continue this tradition in the coming years.</p>\n<p><em>The opinions expressed here are those of Dr. Sandeep Krishnamurthy.

What will it take to land the funding needed to become a billion-dollar company?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/phil-boyer-4a48b03b\">Phil Boyer</a>, partner at Crosslink Capital, answered these questions and more as part of an event hosted by Flying Fish Partners called Road to Series A, a new virtual event series put on by the Seattle venture capital firm. Boyer spoke with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-a-nelson/\">Lisa Nelson</a>, the former managing director of Microsoft’s venture fund M12 who is now a venture partner at Flying Fish. <em>(Editor&#8217;s note: Flying Fish is hosting the event series in partnership with GeekWire)</em></p>\n<p>Boyer joined Bay Area-based Crosslink after stints with RBC Capital and Credit Suisse. He focuses on early-stage investments across B2B software themes such as process automation and DevOps, as described <a href=\"https://philboyer.medium.com/2021-investment-focus-digital-transformation-act-ii-data-agility-and-industry-transformation-e36939c385c0\">in a recent blog post</a>.</p>\n<p>Here are tips from Boyer for founders that are looking to raise their Series A:</p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s about the team: </strong>Some founders assume that once they hit $1 million in ARR there&#8217;s a &#8220;magic thing that happens where you raise a Series A.&#8221; That&#8217;s not how it works, Boyer said.</p>\n<p>Revenue can be a great data point, but he&#8217;s more interested in the leaders themselves and if they&#8217;re equipped to take the company from beta to a scalable business. Boyer seeks founders who have past experience that provided unique insights into the problem they are tackling. He also looks at the first few hires to get an idea of the founder&#8217;s vision and his or her self-awareness to be able to fill gaps.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Did the founders have this really compelling vision and view of the future that attracts really interesting people who are also dropping everything to go join forces?&#8221; he noted.</p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s also about the market:</strong> In addition to the quality of the founding team, Boyer prioritizes the size and opportunity of a market ahead of any metrics. That can come through in various ways depending on the type of business. If it&#8217;s a deep infrastructure product for enterprise, for example, is the startup showing that it can land its first set of six-figure deals? If it&#8217;s a company targeting SMBs, is there a huge addressable amount of customers to sell to?</p>\n<p>Boyer says: &#8220;It&#8217;s showing that you have enough early proof to get someone to say, &#8216;if these folks execute on the product roadmap and on professionalizing their sales and marketing team, I can see this company getting to $100 million in ARR within the markets they are going after.&#8217;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The more you can prove against that thesis, the higher valuation and higher price you&#8217;re going to get in the Series A.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Practice your pitch — and be honest:</strong> The easiest thing to do to get ahead and separate yourself from other startups is to refine your pitch and your story with friends, co-workers, advisors, family, etc. &#8220;It&#8217;s a very simple thing to do and it&#8217;s important,&#8221; Boyer said. &#8220;Investors are meeting with 10 other companies that day. You have to have signal through the noise.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Be honest about your progress and your projections, Boyer added — investors are good at wading through the BS. And it will come back to bite you at some point in the process. &#8220;Be straightforward and have high integrity in what you&#8217;re showing investors,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p><strong>On advisory boards: </strong>It can be a &#8220;strong weapon&#8221; for early-stage companies to have a group of advisors, Boyer said. But don&#8217;t just have one to have one — make sure the advisory board is made up of people that will actually add value. Boyer has seen some top-notch advisors who have daily touchpoints with a founding team. &#8220;That is absolutely worth it if you&#8217;re able to get that kind of insight for cutting an options deal with that person to add them on as an advisor,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p><strong>Don&#8217;t discount less senior folks: </strong>You don&#8217;t need to speak to a managing director or general partner to get the attention of a VC firm. It&#8217;s totally fine to start a conversation with an associate — they are the ones often driving the due diligence process anyways, Boyer said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s smart to ignore an associate or push them aside as not important,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think they&#8217;re crucial.&#8221;</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Amazon&#8217;s new approach to &#8216;Human Capital&#8217; is a telling takeaway from its annual regulatory report</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazons-new-approach-human-capital-telling-takeaway-annual-regulatory-report/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2021 16:31:48 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Todd Bishop]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Amazon]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Amazon fulfillment]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[covid]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[employees]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Jeff Bezos]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Safety]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.geekwire.com/?p=605454</guid>\n\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img width=\"1260\" height=\"840\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Campus_1-1260x840.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Campus_1-1260x840.jpg 1260w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Campus_1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Campus_1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Campus_1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Campus_1-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1260px) 100vw, 1260px\"><br>Customers are still No. 1 at Amazon, but the tech giant now wants it to be known, officially, that employees are also &#8220;critical&#8221; to its customer-centric mission.

(The section makes no reference to unions anymore, which is notable given the <strong><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/02/07/965162338/in-alabama-workers-at-amazon-warehouse-are-poised-for-union-vote\">ongoing union vote at the company&#8217;s Alabama warehouse</a>.</strong>) Elsewhere in the filing, the company still lists international labor unions, and the potential for disruptions from labor disputes, among the risk factors to its business.</p>\n<p><strong>Worker safety:</strong> The 10-K notes that the company has added more than 400,000 workers since February 2020 to increase its fulfillment center capacity, largely in response to skyrocketing demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. That growth has put an increased focus on worker safety in its fulfillment and distribution centers.</p>\n<p>The New York Times Magazine explores the issue this week in the piece, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/magazine/amazon-workers-employees-covid-19.html?referringSource=articleShare\"><strong>&#8220;Amazon&#8217;s Great Labor Awakening.&#8221;</strong></a> Writer Erika Hayasaki tells the stories of Amazon workers and observes, &#8220;[W]hile Amazon has often acknowledged that workers have the right to unionize, the company has tried to persuade them that doing so would introduce an unnecessary middleman. But Covid-19 proved to be a breaking point. Some workers were no longer willing to make concessions to a company that they felt was jeopardizing their safety and potentially their lives.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Amazon&#8217;s 10-K says that the company spent more than $11.5 billion on COVID-19 related costs in 2020, including extensive safety measures.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We will continue to prioritize employee and customer safety,&#8221; the filing says, &#8220;and comply with evolving federal, state, and local standards as well as to implement standards or processes that we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, and communities.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Previously</strong>: <strong><a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2021/california-eclipses-washington-amazons-biggest-state-jobs-153k-employees-counting/\">California eclipses Washington as Amazon’s biggest state for jobs, with 153k employees and counting</a></strong></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Week in Review: Most popular stories on GeekWire for the week of Feb. 14, 2021</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.geekwire.com/2021/geekwire-weekly-roundup-2021-02-14/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2021 16:01:07 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[GeekWire]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[GeekWire Weekly]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.geekwire.com/2021/geekwire-weekly-roundup-2021-02-14/</guid>\n\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/geekwire-week-in-review1.png\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"GeekWire Week in Review\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/geekwire-week-in-review1.png 1200w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/geekwire-week-in-review1-620x326.png 620w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"><br>See the technology stories that people were reading on GeekWire for the week of Feb. 14, 2021.&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2021/geekwire-weekly-roundup-2021-02-14/\">Read More</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[\n<p>Get caught up on the latest technology and startup news from the past week.

All three Build It products are a &#8220;Day 1 Editions concept&#8221; — Amazon has applied this label before to two products it considered producing based on early user feedback: the <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2020/amazon-focuses-another-use-alexa-echo-frames-smart-glasses-now-available/\">Echo Frames smart glasses</a> that got the green light, and the <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2019/live-updates-amazon-unveils-new-alexa-powered-devices-media-event-seattle/\">Loop smart ring</a> that didn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>The first Build It gadget lets you print notes with Alexa (it needs to be paired to a compatible Echo device). Because it is a thermal printer, it never needs ink or toner. While the initial $90 price includes one yellow sticky paper roll, you&#8217;ll have to refill it with yellow, blue, pink, or white paper when the first roll runs out. Now that the goal has been reached, the price will increase at 8:59 AM Pacific on March 19, though Amazon didn&#8217;t specify by how much.</p>\n<p>The other two products, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SPBLN1C/\">Smart Nutrition Scale</a> ($35) and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08TCL7ZLQ\">Smart Cuckoo Clock</a> ($80), are at 42% and 37% of their goals, respectively. Unlike Kickstarter and Indiegogo, which display a total dollar amount or total number of preorders as their goals, Build It campaigns only show a percentage progress bar.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full-width wp-image-605440\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thermal-printer-goal-reached-630x289.png\" alt=\"Amazon sticky note thermal printer goal reached\" width=\"630\" height=\"289\" srcset=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thermal-printer-goal-reached-630x289.png 630w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thermal-printer-goal-reached-1260x578.png 1260w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thermal-printer-goal-reached-768x352.png 768w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thermal-printer-goal-reached-1536x704.png 1536w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thermal-printer-goal-reached-2048x939.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /></p>\n<p>Still, given the month-long goal window, the first Build It products appear to be winners.

But at least this helps me to say, “OK, I need to cut down in these areas so I can allocate my time into the right areas.” It brings me an awareness of where my time went.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_604661\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-604661\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full-width wp-image-604661\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jobscan-office-warming-party-630x473.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"473\" srcset=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jobscan-office-warming-party-630x473.jpg 630w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jobscan-office-warming-party-1260x945.jpg 1260w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jobscan-office-warming-party-768x576.jpg 768w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jobscan-office-warming-party.jpg 1277w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-604661\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hu and a colleague at a pre-COVID office warming party.

How do you use it for business/work? </strong>When it comes to social media, I use Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and LINE. It depends on what my friends use. On the business/work side, I use Slack and LinkedIn. We are hiring, so if you reach out via LinkedIn, we might just connect.</p>\n<p><strong>Current number of unanswered emails in your inbox? </strong>Zero, if it’s in the “Primary” folder in Gmail. I finish the important emails every single day. I&#8217;ve set up my email very deliberately so I don’t have more than 20 emails a day. The rest are updates, newsletters and promotions categorized in other tabs where I only glance through.</p>\n<p><strong>Number of appointments/meetings on your calendar this week? </strong>Right now, I have 14 appointments/meetings slated for this week. That’s mostly due to the time zone difference, and riding out the COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan. As it stands, I can only get about 3-to-4 hours of meeting overlap time with my team in Seattle. If the time zones allowed, I would definitely prefer being able to connect more with them.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you run meetings? </strong>I try to let my team lead the majority of meetings. However if it’s a meeting I specifically asked for, I have an agenda ready. I like my meetings short and to the point. The meetings usually result in action items or deliverables, so time is not wasted. I make sure we have the minimum number of people needed in the room, so we’re not wasting others’ time when they can be productive elsewhere.</p>\n<p><strong>Everyday work uniform? </strong>Honestly, whatever is comfortable that day.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you make time for family? </strong>I dedicate one day a week to my family. Right now it’s Mondays because it’s still Sunday in the U.S. We typically go out of town to see something new — viewpoints, hikes, waterfalls, attractions. We at least have dinner together if someone is busy during the day time.</p>\n<p><strong>Best stress reliever? How do you unplug? </strong>I typically meet with friends. If that’s not an option, I nap. Sleep is my superpower. I’m gone in 60 seconds. A 15-minute nap gives me enough rest and resets my mood. It’s quite effective. Otherwise, I write diaries and let my voices be heard, even if it’s just for myself.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_604662\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-604662\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full-width wp-image-604662\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/James-Hu-headshot-informal-630x420.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"420\" srcset=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/James-Hu-headshot-informal-630x420.jpg 630w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/James-Hu-headshot-informal-1260x840.jpg 1260w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/James-Hu-headshot-informal-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/James-Hu-headshot-informal-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/James-Hu-headshot-informal-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-604662\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hu with the Seattle waterfront in the distance.

I like Latin music. I switch between Latin and dance music during the day. They both get me pumped and excited. But when I need to block outside noise, I listen to classical music or jazz.</p>\n<p><strong>Daily reads? Favorite sites and newsletters? </strong>My daily reads include Business Insider, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and CNN. I also try to watch BBC, Al Jazeera, Bloomberg and news channels in Taiwan for a wider perspective. I also use Feedly and have a curated list of more than 50 news outlets and publications that I follow and read.</p>\n<p><strong>Book on your nightstand (or e-reader)? </strong>I’m reading from a Kindle, and right now it&#8217;s &#8220;Principles&#8221; by Ray Dalio.</p>\n<p><strong>Night owl or early riser? </strong>You can say I’m a bit of both. I tend to go to sleep at 11:30 p.m. and wake up by 7 a.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Where do you get your best ideas? </strong>I try to reflect for at least 10 minutes a day. Sometimes this runs into 30 minutes. This is a time of silence where all I do is think with a notebook and a pen. I turn my phone to sleep mode so there are no distractions. This has proven valuable in helping me reflect on my mistakes, remember things I haven’t done, and guiding the direction of my life and business goals.</p>\n<p><strong>Whose work style would you want to learn more about or emulate? </strong>Although there is no one in particular that I emulate, I do find Jeff Bezos&#8217; management style interesting. I have also adopted Bill Gates’ &#8220;think week&#8221; — an annual stretch of time spent unplugged and without distraction — and have found them to be extremely valuable.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Amazon vs. Shopify: What the tech giant&#8217;s latest deal says about its larger retail ambitions</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-vs-shopify-tech-giants-latest-deal-says-larger-retail-ambitions/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 20 Feb 2021 18:40:59 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Todd Bishop]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Podcasts]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Bigcommerce]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[e-commerce]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Jason Boyce]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Shopify]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.geekwire.com/?p=605408</guid>\n\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img width=\"630\" height=\"473\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-new.png\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"><br>When Jeff Bezos named e-commerce software company Shopify as an example of Amazon&#8217;s growing competition in his testimony to a U.S. House antitrust subcommittee last year, e-commerce consultant and former Amazon seller Jason Boyce wasn&#8217;t buying it.

He&#8217;s the co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://avenue7media.com/\"><strong>Avenue7Media</strong>,</a> and the co-author of<strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Jungle-Survival-Commerce-Marketplace-ebook/dp/B08K3PQGJ8\"> The Amazon Jungle: The Seller’s Survival Guide for Thriving on the World’s Most Perilous E-Commerce Marketplace</a></strong>. A former U.S. Marine, he was an Amazon seller for 17 years, before finally giving up after Amazon repeatedly launched products that competed with his, as detailed in the House Judiciary Committee&#8217;s antitrust subcommittee report last year (<a href=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/competition_in_digital_markets.pdf\">page 279</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Listen to the episode above, or <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/podcast/\">subscribe to GeekWire in any podcast app</a>, and continue reading for key takeaways.</strong></p>\n<p><b>How Amazon and Shopify stacked up historically: </b>Up to this point, it was hard a stretch to Shopify and Amazon as direct competitors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little bit of a false equivalency, Shopify and Amazon,&#8221; Boyce says. &#8220;You don&#8217;t go to Shopify.com to buy a product. In that regard, we&#8217;re talking about zebras vs. an elephant, they&#8217;re different animals entirely.&#8221;</li>\n<li>Another big difference: Shopify focuses on merchants as its customers, while Amazon is legendary for putting the customer above all else, and owes much of its success to this approach.</li>\n<li>Amazon ran a Shopify-like service called Webstore but<strong> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/3/18/11560456/amazon-will-shut-down-amazon-webstore-its-competitor-to-shopify-and\">shut it down in 2015</a>. </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s different now: </strong>Shopify&#8217;s growth and Amazon&#8217;s ambitions are putting the companies on a collision course.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shopify <strong><a href=\"https://s23.q4cdn.com/550512644/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Press-Release-Q4-2020.pdf\">revenue increased 86% in 2020</a></strong>, to more than $2.9 billion. That&#8217;s still a fraction of<strong><a href=\"https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2021/Amazon.com-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-Results/\"> the $386.1 billion pulled in by Amazon</a></strong>, but Shopify&#8217;s growth rate is significant, demonstrating the potential of powering standalone third-party e-commerce stores. This is clearly catching Amazon&#8217;s eye.</li>\n<li>Amazon is also in a much different place than it was six years ago, having built up its fulfillment and last-mile delivery operations to better support (and make money from) third-party sellers, while also <strong><a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2021/advertising-surge-lifts-amazons-segment-past-subscription-business-pace-rival-aws/\">building up its advertising business</a></strong> to better support (and make money from) third party sellers.</li>\n<li>Revenue from Amazon’s third-party seller services rose 57% in the holiday quarter to $27.3 billion, making up 21% of the company’s total revenue.</li>\n<li>&#8220;Even though they&#8217;re a little bit behind in this space, Amazon comes at this with an enormous advantage that will take tens of billions of Shopify investor dollars to solve,&#8221; Boyce says. &#8220;If I&#8217;m Shopify, I&#8217;m much more nervous than I was before this announcement came out. Much more nervous.&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Amazon tech in physical retail stores: </b>Amazon isn&#8217;t just involved in online commerce; the company operates its own physical stores. Shopify&#8217;s platform already extends to point-of-sale terminals for merchants with physical stores. It&#8217;s not a stretch to imagine Amazon ultimately extending its own technology into third-party physical retail stores, perhaps with a more comprehensive solution, including the technology that powers its Amazon Go cashier-less grocery and convenience stores</p>\n<p><strong>What this means for retailers:</strong> The ability to run a standalone e-commerce site, while leveraging Amazon&#8217;s fulfillment infrastructure and advertising infrastructure, will no doubt be enticing to many retailers. But it&#8217;s a double-edged sword. Amazon maintains that it doesn&#8217;t use individual seller data to inform its own product decisions, but based on his own experience as a seller, Boyce advises caution in giving the company even more data, competitive insights, and market power.</p>\n<p><strong>Big picture: </strong>Amazon &#8220;has put themselves into this position of judge, jury and executioner for literally the livelihood of millions of small businesses,&#8221; and it needs to be held accountable, especially as it extends its reach, Boyce says.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Amazon wouldn&#8217;t be what it is today without the hard work, the grit, the capital, the product knowledge of the third party seller, of which there are millions, and there will be millions more,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The sellers deserve a seat at the table.&#8221;</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Here&#8217;s what Bill Gates is doing — and not doing — to help fight climate change</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.geekwire.com/2021/heres-bill-gates-not-help-fight-climate-change/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 20 Feb 2021 16:00:46 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Lisa Stiffler]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tech]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Bill Gates]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Breakthrough Energy]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Climate change]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.geekwire.com/?p=604378</guid>\n\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/snapshot-smile.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/snapshot-smile.jpg 854w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/snapshot-smile-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/snapshot-smile-630x354.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px\"><br>Climate change is by definition a global challenge, and in his new book, &#8220;How to Avoid a Climate Disaster,&#8221; Bill Gates describes solutions that require an all-hands response including government, companies, institutions and individuals.

Here are some actions individuals can take to move us closer to a zero-carbon future: <a href=\"https://t.co/ALBni7g2IP\">https://t.co/ALBni7g2IP</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Bill Gates (@BillGates) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillGates/status/1362859066079383554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 19, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>But even with Gates&#8217; increasing investments in climate-related initiatives, critics point to shortcomings in his actions, such as his foundation&#8217;s struggles to make good on his commitment to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-15/bill-gates-in-new-climate-book-talks-about-finally-divesting-from-oil?cmpid=BBD021721_GREENDAILY&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=210217&amp;utm_campaign=greendaily\">divest from fossil fuel interests</a> and his recent investment in a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/bill-gates-joins-private-equity-firms-in-4-7-billion-deal-for-private-jet-company-11612534767\">private jet company.</a></p>\n<p>In a recent interview about his book, I asked Gates how he viewed his role in the climate crisis, the status of TerraPower and his thoughts on geoengineering — the controversial strategy of helping cool the planet through man-made alterations of the atmosphere. Here are five takeaways from that conversation:</p>\n<p><strong>He&#8217;s doing more on climate, but is still focused on global health through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. </strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where we&#8217;re expert — our malaria team, our vaccine factory team — and that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re going to stay committed,&#8221; Gates said. &#8220;And the returns on that, the impact of that, is phenomenal. It also happens that as kids grow up more healthily, their parents choose to have less kids. And so between improving health and getting voluntary family planning tools out there, there is a connection with climate.</p>\n<p>Also, our foundation, because of our agriculture work, is the biggest funder of climate adaptation. And that involves, in many cases, giving better seeds to these subsistence farmers so they can deal with drought and floods and higher temperatures.</p>\n<aside class=\"callout clearfix\">\n<h4 class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2021/avoid-climate-disaster-bill-gates-charts-difficult-course-might-just-doable/\">In ‘How to Avoid a Climate Disaster,’ Bill Gates charts a difficult course that might just be doable</a></h4>\n</aside>\n<p>&#8230;The foundation, through its health and reproductive health and agriculture work, it&#8217;s helping with climate, but that&#8217;s not the primary lens that that foundation money is spent on. It&#8217;s spent on saving lives, which is still, I think, a super, super important thing.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>While massive, Gates&#8217; wealth — currently estimated at about <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/bill-gates/?sh=33a0d55b689f\">$124 billion</a> — can&#8217;t fix global warming.</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;In the case of climate change, even the money that I have, if it was all applied in this direction — I put in $2 billion so far and I&#8217;ll put in another $2 billion over the next five years — that&#8217;s not enough to solve it. The role of high-risk investing and philanthropy and creating programs like <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2021/bill-gates-high-risk-climate-investments-spurring-innovation-save-planet/\">[Breakthrough Energy&#8217;s] Fellows and Ventures and Catalyst</a> &#8230; the role of philanthropy is to start things out, but it&#8217;s really government policy [that] has to carry this one.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>He has made limited investments in geoengineering, and that might be it. </strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Geoengineering, we don&#8217;t know enough about what the side effects of that would be, and so it is interesting. And at the very least we should understand the problems so that nobody goes and does it unilaterally, because the atmosphere is this important shared resource.</p>\n<p>In some extreme case, if things got a lot worse quicker than we expect, you might use it to buy yourself 10 or 20 years of the negative effects. But even then, getting the right type of government consensus on whether to do it would be difficult. Getting the people in the lab to figure out some of what works, what we don&#8217;t understand about global weather effects, I think that is constructive, but it&#8217;s very small money. Nothing compared to what I&#8217;m putting into other climate areas.</p>\n<p>I certainly wouldn&#8217;t want to [pursue geoengineering projects] alone. I&#8217;d want to feel like there were at least some countries and a broad set of scientists and other people, otherwise it&#8217;s kind of like a mad scientist-type insanity. I feel like I&#8217;ve done my part to seed that field a little bit, and if others want to come in, fine. I don&#8217;t see myself going up dramatically.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Widespread, green-tech advances in transportation, electricity, agriculture, construction and heating and cooling systems are next-level difficult, and Gates is studying up on innovation. </strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;If you just look at what&#8217;s happened in the chip and software and internet area, if you think anything like that can happen in the physical economy, that would confuse you. That type of speed of improvement and cost reduction, there&#8217;s no other domain like it. In fact, even in medicine, that moves way more slowly than the digital world. Even there, in 10 years time, you can do some very dramatic things. And that&#8217;s a very hopeful space.</p>\n<p>But now we&#8217;re talking about a part of the economy that&#8217;s physically the largest. Very little R&amp;D, very little change over the last few decades. And yet we&#8217;re saying in 30 years, we&#8217;re going to change it very, very dramatically. So it&#8217;s certainly way harder than the advances that have taken place in other areas.</p>\n<p>I do think that the template of accelerating innovation by finding smart people and having risk capital and funding basic R&amp;D and creating market-based price signals, I think those apply very much. I&#8217;ve had to learn about these new areas, reading a lot of books and meeting a lot of experts. But my sense of how you drive innovation is part of what I&#8217;m bringing to this, suggesting that we can have a plan to go along with the goal and the energy that the advocates are putting out.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Gates is bullish on nuclear and eager for his Bellevue-based company TerraPower to build a demo plant.</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Congress created a program, the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, and TerraPower competed in that and <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/us-department-energy-announces-160-million-first-awards-under-advanced-reactor\">won a large award</a> for the $4 billion demo plant. And so over the next five years, <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/business/bellevue-based-terrapower-gets-80-million-federal-grant-to-develop-next-generation-nuclear-power-plant/\">that&#8217;ll get built</a>, and it&#8217;ll show people the economics and the safety.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the only from-scratch reactor design that&#8217;s been done going back to the 1950s, where we can use digital tools to simulate any problem and really optimize all these components. Because nuclear power, despite all the waste and safety and proliferation concerns, the main reason it&#8217;s failing right now is that the reactors have gotten so costly to build. They&#8217;re just not competitive, particularly in a place where natural gas is so incredibly inexpensive.&#8221;</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Bad weather slows COVID-19 vaccination drive, but experts see clearer skies ahead</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.geekwire.com/2021/bad-weather-slows-covid-19-vaccination-drive-experts-see-clearer-skies-ahead/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 20 Feb 2021 01:35:54 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Alan Boyle]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Health/Life Sciences]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Science]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[coronavirus]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[COVID-19]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[COVID-19 vaccine]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Health]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Vaccines]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.geekwire.com/?p=605345</guid>\n\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img width=\"1260\" height=\"1020\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210219-sticker-1260x1020.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"Vaccination stickers\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210219-sticker-1260x1020.jpg 1260w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210219-sticker-768x622.jpg 768w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210219-sticker-1536x1244.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210219-sticker-2048x1659.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210219-sticker-630x510.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1260px) 100vw, 1260px\"><br>They say that the second vaccine shot for COVID-19 is rougher than the first one — and we&#8217;re not just talking about the side effects.

This week&#8217;s second shot gave me body aches the day after, as if I had been shoveling snow for hours. (Which, come to think of it, I was &#8230; a couple of days earlier.)</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s nothing compared to the headaches I would have given myself if I had tried to schedule a vaccination this week. I would have been hard-pressed to find an appointment, even with the benefit of websites like <a href=\"https://www.covidwa.com/\">WA COVID Vaccine Finder</a>, the Washington State Department of Health&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.doh.wa.gov/YouandYourFamily/Immunization/VaccineLocations\">Vaccine Locator</a> and the <a href=\"https://prepmod.doh.wa.gov/\">Washington State COVID-19 Vaccination Sign Up System</a>.</p>\n<p>Jeffrey Duchin, health officer for Public Health &#8211; Seattle &amp; King County, acknowledged that it&#8217;s been a tough slog for some folks. &#8220;I wish we had more vaccine, and had vaccine for everyone,&#8221; he said today during a news briefing.</p>\n<h4 class=\"callout clearfix\"><strong>Previously:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2021/one-mans-quest-covid-19-vaccine-tips-remember-time-immunized/\">One man&#8217;s quest for the COVID-19 vaccine</a></h4>\n<p>&#8220;Severe winter storms across the nation have led to delays in vaccine shipments, and this has impacted the vaccinations that are taking place here in Washington state and in King County, both those scheduled this week and into the weekend,&#8221; he explained.</p>\n<p>Hundreds of second-shot appointments have had to be rescheduled, and first-shot appointments are few and far between. Community vaccination sites in Auburn and Kent, which were set up to boost COVID-19 immunization rates in South King County, are being shut down this weekend.<a href=\"https://kingcounty.gov/depts/health/covid-19/vaccine/distribution.aspx\"> (Check the Public Health &#8211; Seattle &amp; King County website for updates.)</a></p>\n<p>I could see signs of the vaccine shortage when I headed to the hospital on Monday for my second shot: The line to get in was nearly non-existent, apparently because so many appointments were already in the process of being rescheduled.</p>\n<p>That could start changing next week. Vaccine outlets are expected to get a double dose of supplies, as delayed shipments are added to the regular allotment.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Over the next two weeks there will be very limited opportunities for first doses,&#8221; Duchin said. &#8220;Most of the vaccine coming in will be for administering second doses.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Duchin said he&#8217;s not worried about being overwhelmed. &#8220;We&#8217;re not talking about a huge amount of doses to start with,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think our experience has been, from working with our providers, that they&#8217;ve got the capacity to administer many more vaccines than they&#8217;ve been able to, given the limited supply.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite the weather-related delays, Duchin said he&#8217;s encouraged by the process that&#8217;s been made so far. &#8220;Over 400,000 doses have been administered to King County residents, including about 65,000 in the last week,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Duchin said about 300,000 people, or one out of every six county residents, have gotten at least one vaccine dose. About 119,000 people, or one in 16 county residents, are fully vaccinated.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re making progress also in vaccinating older adults, who are most vulnerable to complications and deaths from COVID-19,&#8221; Duchin said. &#8220;Fifty-two percent of those 75 and older have received at least one dose. That&#8217;s up from 44% last week.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Duchin said the comparable figure for the 65-to-74 age group is 46%, up from 40%.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_605376\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-605376\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full-width wp-image-605376\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210219-arm-630x473.jpg\" alt=\"After the shot\" width=\"630\" height=\"473\" srcset=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210219-arm-630x473.jpg 630w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210219-arm-1260x945.jpg 1260w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210219-arm-768x576.jpg 768w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210219-arm-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210219-arm-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-605376\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">GeekWire&#8217;s Alan Boyle check out his arm after a second COVID-19 vaccination at Overlake Hospital and Medical Center in Bellevue, Wash.

In the 65-and-older category, Duchin listed vaccination rates of 50% for American Indians and Alaska Natives, and 45% for whites — but only 37% for Asians, 37% for Hispanics and 25% for Blacks.</p>\n<p>County officials are working with community groups to reach underrepresented populations, as well as home-bound adults. &#8220;We now have a total of 17 mobile teams in the field vaccinating high-risk populations across the county, reaching residents at adult family homes and affordable-housing buildings with large senior populations,&#8221; Duchin said.</p>\n<p>When it comes to vaccine supply, there&#8217;s reason for optimism on the national level as well. This week, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that vaccination rates <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/daily-covid-19-vaccinations-could-nearly-double-by-the-end-of-march-if-supply-keeps-up/\">could nearly double by the end of March</a> as states work out the kinks in their distribution systems.</p>\n<p>Getting as many people as possible vaccinated quickly will be key to avoiding a &#8220;fourth wave&#8221; of deadly COVID-19 infections. Thankfully, this winter&#8217;s third wave is rapidly winding down in Washington state. &#8220;We are 80% of the way back to where we were in September, before the fall and winter surge,&#8221; Duchin said.</p>\n<p>Health officials attribute that decline to closer observance of mask-wearing and social distancing now that the season for holiday gatherings is over. Duchin said there&#8217;s also &#8220;the potential for the virus to be exhausting certain social networks.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But Duchin also cautioned that the rise of new variants of coronavirus will add to the urgency. &#8220;The proportion of cases due to the more contagious B.1.1.7 variant continues to grow, and that proportion doubles approximately every 10 days,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That means, sometime in March, most of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that&#8217;s circulating will be the variant strain. &#8230; It would be reckless not to be more careful and more effective in our prevention measures against a stronger virus.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe title=\"Experts Weigh In On Life After The Vaccine | NBC Nightly News\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bzl3YRcj1To?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>For now, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is advising even fully vaccinated folks to keep wearing masks when going out, keep staying at least 6 feet away from people outside your personal bubble, and continue to avoid large indoor gatherings. But Anthony Fauci, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said this week in an <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/andrea-mitchell-reports/watch/fauci-on-when-life-can-return-back-to-normal-amid-covid-pandemic-new-variants-101239365645\">MSNBC interview</a> that the rules could soon be modified for folks like me.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you are vaccinated, and you are with someone who&#8217;s vaccinated, the things that you can do are much, much more liberal in the sense of pulling back on stringent public health measures versus when you&#8217;re out in society,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Fauci cited the example of one family member meeting up with another, where neither lives with the other but both have been vaccinated. &#8220;Can I actually be with them without a mask? Can I sit down and give them a hug, and things like that?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;The answer is very likely, &#8216;Of course you can.'&#8221;</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s music to the ears of someone who&#8217;s planning to get together with siblings for the first time in more than a year.

Why are politicians behaving the way that they behave?</p>\n<p>DeVaan spoke about his work in political reform on a recent episode of the <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/podcast/\">GeekWire Podcast</a>.

Microsoft is in the throes of its antitrust trial. And Orrin Hatch, in veiled, but clear language tells Microsoft, &#8220;If you&#8217;d have been giving your political contributions, you wouldn&#8217;t have any of this trouble now,&#8221; which is a fantastically corrupt statement. And of course, we weren&#8217;t dummies at Microsoft. Not dummies now either, just to be clear. So we started giving our political contributions. That&#8217;s when the Microsoft PAC (Political Action Committee) was created.</p>\n<p>And it was an insider seat that I had to see how ridiculous it was, and how wrong it was, but necessary if you wanted to have a seat at the table in government. When I left in 2014, I started investigating how we can fix this. And that&#8217;s how I came to know Represent Us, which I like because of its execution ability, the way it talks about the political system as having been corrupted, and also the set of policies that we champion around the country to fix it, and make it not have to be a pay-to-play system anymore.</p>\n<p><strong>What about the impact of disinformation on the political system?</strong> We absolutely have to figure out what to do about disinformation. And what&#8217;s interesting is that that duopoly structure and the incentives that it creates is why political parties don&#8217;t push back on people foisting the disinformation. And just recently we had the president of the United States foisting the disinformation. If we can change the incentives, then the disinformation will settle down. But I agree that in the long run, we still have to do a lot of work to figure out how to make sure that the marketplace of ideas is really competitive.</p>\n<p><strong>What should companies do right now while we&#8217;re waiting for reform?</strong> First of all, all companies that have paused their donations, I think that&#8217;s a very positive thing. And I hope that they join Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2021/microsoft-pac-wont-donate-2022-cycle-politicians-sought-overturn-election/\">at least in the embargo of donations</a> to people who contributed to what happened on January 6. I think that&#8217;s really a bare minimum.</p>\n<p><strong>What about the larger issue of campaign finance?</strong> Represent Us advocates a policy we call the <a href=\"https://represent.us/anticorruption-act/\">American Anti-Corruption Act</a>. And actually back in 2015, that Anti-Corruption Act was used as a starting point for what eventually became the <a href=\"https://www.seattle.gov/democracyvoucher/about-the-program/honest-elections-seattle-initiative\">Seattle Honest Elections Law</a>. The way that public financing works in Seattle with the ethics board and the public vouchers, we see is the best way to do public financing of campaigns. And we believe that all campaigns should be publicly financed.</p>\n<p><strong>How is Seattle&#8217;s implementation of this concept working?</strong> &#8220;I think it&#8217;s working pretty well. You&#8217;re seeing the amount of money that flows into elections becoming much more even. It&#8217;s not just the high wealth zip codes that are contributing money to elections now. I think that&#8217;s a really positive thing. You&#8217;re seeing a lot more people run, and I think that&#8217;s a really positive thing. And that has to lead to better representation of people inside the city. And we have some tough issues inside the city now with homelessness and Amazon and other things. And as far as I can tell, the citizens aren&#8217;t necessarily super aligned on what should happen. I think that means we have to have more voices inside the political process trying to influence it so that we can figure it out.</p>\n<p><strong>Further steps:</strong> There is a historic opportunity right now to support the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1/text\">For the People Act, HR 1,</a> in Congress. It gets positioned as a Democratic Party thing that&#8217;s bad for Republicans, but it&#8217;s really not. If you have concerns about making sure that voter rolls are accurate, if you have concerns about that votes are secure and that you can do audits to make sure that the election results are correct, you want HR 1 to pass.</p>\n<p>This notion of how politicians choose their voters instead of voters choosing their politicians through gerrymandering is probably the number-one cause that leads to polarization. If you don&#8217;t like that, HR 1 will stop gerrymandering by drawing districts with a non-partisan commission. Really important.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t like the way that that money and lobbying influence works in Congress, HR 1 helps that. And it has some beginnings on helping balance the powers so that the executive branch just can&#8217;t ignore the oversight capabilities of Congress.</p>\n<p>So those are all really positive things. They are not partisan in any way. They are just about making the system better, make it easier for citizens to express their will at the ballot box, and in a way that hopefully it will foster honest and reasonable debate going into the future.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2021/upgrade-democracy-former-microsoft-executive-jon-devaans-primer-political-reform/\"><b>See this post</b></a><strong> for Jon DeVaan&#8217;s list of recommended books, articles and other resources that have informed his understanding of these issues. </strong></p>\n<em><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> Microsoft provides financial support for GeekWire's independent journalism as underwriter of our civic coverage.

(PNNL Photo)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Imagine a future where new therapeutic drugs are designed far faster and at a fraction of the cost they are today, enabled by the rapidly developing field of quantum computing.</p>\n<p>The transformation on healthcare and personalized medicine would be tremendous, yet these are hardly the only fields this novel form of computing could revolutionize. From cryptography to supply-chain optimization to advances in solid-state physics, the coming era of quantum computers could bring about enormous changes, assuming its potential can be fully realized.</p>\n<p>Yet many hurdles still need to be overcome before all of this can happen. This one of the reasons the <a href=\"https://www.pnnl.gov/\">Pacific Northwest National Laboratory</a> and Microsoft have teamed up to advance this nascent field.</p>\n<p>The developer of the Q# programming language, Microsoft Quantum <a href=\"https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/quantum/2020/11/16/microsoft-quantum-pnnl-supercomputing/\">recently announced the creation of an intermediate bridge</a> that will allow Q# and other languages to be used to send instructions to different quantum hardware platforms. This includes the simulations being performed on PNNL’s own powerful supercomputers, which are used to test the quantum algorithms that could one day run on those platforms. While scalable quantum computing is still years away, these simulations make it possible to design and test many of the approaches that will eventually be used.</p>\n<p>“We have extensive experience in terms of parallel programming for supercomputers,” said PNNL computer scientist Sriram Krishnamoorthy. “The question was, how do you use these classical supercomputers to understand how a quantum algorithm and quantum architectures would behave while we build these systems?”</p>\n<p>That’s an important question given that classical and quantum computing are so extremely different from each other. Quantum computing isn’t Classical Computing 2.0. A quantum computer is no more an improved version of a classical computer than a lightbulb is a better version of a candle. While you might use one to simulate the other, that simulation will never be perfect because they’re such fundamentally different technologies.</p>\n<p>Classical computing is based on bits, pieces of information that are either off or on to represent a zero or one. But a quantum bit, or qubit, can represent a zero or a one or any proportion of those two values at the same time. This makes it possible to perform computations in a very different way.</p>\n<p>However, a qubit can only do this so long as it remains in a special state known as superposition. This, along with other features of quantum behavior such as entanglement, could potentially allow quantum computing to answer all kinds of complex problems, many of which are exponential in nature. These are exactly the kind of problems that classical computers can’t readily solve — if they can solve them at all.</p>\n<p>For instance, much of the world’s electronic privacy is based on encryption methods that rely on prime numbers. While it’s easy to multiply two prime numbers, it’s extremely difficult to reverse the process by factoring the product of two primes. In some cases, a classical computer could run for 10,000 years and still not find the solution. A quantum computer, on the other hand, might be capable of performing the work in seconds.</p>\n<p>That doesn’t mean quantum computing will replace all tasks performed by classical computers. This includes programming the quantum computers themselves, which the very nature of quantum behaviors can make highly challenging. For instance, just the act of observing a qubit can make it decohere, causing it to lose its superposition and entangled states.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe title=\"How to run quantum programs at scale through an open-source framework\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vwVS5VgykWc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Such challenges drive some of the work being done by Microsoft Azure’s Quantum group. Expecting that both classical and quantum computing resources will be needed for large-scale quantum applications, Microsoft Quantum has developed a bridge they call QIR, which stands for “quantum intermediate representation.&#8221; The motivation behind QIR is to create a common interface at a point in the programming stack that avoids interfering with the qubits. Doing this makes the interface both language- and platform-agnostic, which allows different software and hardware to be used together.</p>\n<p>“To advance the field of quantum computing, we need to think beyond just how to build a particular end-to-end system,” said Bettina Heim, senior software engineering manager with Microsoft Quantum, during a recent presentation. “We need to think about how to grow a global ecosystem that facilitates developing and experimenting with different approaches.”</p>\n<p>Because these are still very early days — think of where classical computing was 75 years ago — many fundamental components still need to be developed and refined in this ecosystem, including quantum gates, algorithms and error correction. This is where PNNL’s quantum simulator, DM-SIM comes in. By designing and testing different approaches and configurations of these elements, they can discover better ways of achieving their goals.</p>\n<p>As Krishnamoorthy explains: “What we currently lack and what we are trying to build with this simulation infrastructure is a turnkey solution that could allow, say a compiler writer or a noise model developer or a systems architect, to try different approaches in putting qubits together and ask the question: ‘If they do this, what happens?’ ”</p>\n<p>Of course, there will be many challenges and disappointments along the way, such as an upcoming retraction of a 2018 paper in the journal, Nature. The original study, partly funded by Microsoft, declared evidence of a theoretical particle called a Majorana fermion, which could have been a major quantum breakthrough. However, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-win-quantum-computing-error/\">errors since found in the data contradict that claim</a>.</p>\n<p>But progress continues, and once reasonably robust and scalable quantum computers are available, all kinds of potential uses could become possible. Supply chain and logistics optimization might be ideal applications, generating new levels of efficiency and energy savings for business. Since quantum computing should also be able to perform very fast searches on unsorted data, applications that focus on financial data, climate data analysis and genomics are likely uses, as well.</p>\n<p>That’s only the beginning. Quantum computers could be used to accurately simulate physical processes from chemistry and solid-state physics, ushering in a new era for these fields. Advances in material science could become possible because we’ll be better able to simulate and identify molecular properties much faster and more accurately than we ever could before. Simulating proteins using quantum computers could lead to new knowledge about biology that would revolutionize healthcare.</p>\n<p>In the future, quantum cryptography may also become common, due to its potential for truly secure encrypted storage and communications. That’s because it’s impossible to precisely copy quantum data without violating the laws of physics. Such encryption will be even more important once quantum computers are commonplace because their unique capabilities will also allow them to swiftly crack traditional methods of encryption as mentioned earlier, rendering many currently robust methods insecure and obsolete.</p>\n<p>As with many new technologies, it can be challenging to envisage all of the potential uses and problems quantum computing might bring about, which is one reason why business and industry need to become involved in its development early on. Adopting an interdisciplinary approach could yield all kinds of new ideas and applications and hopefully help to build what is ultimately a trusted and ethical technology.</p>\n<p>“How do you all work together to make it happen?” asks Krishnamoorthy. “I think for at least the next couple of decades, for chemistry problems, for nuclear theory, etc., we’ll need this hypothetical machine that everyone designs and programs for at the same time, and simulations are going to be crucial to that.”</p>\n<p>The future of quantum computing will bring enormous changes and challenges to our world. From how we secure our most critical data to unlocking the secrets of our genetic code, it’s technology that holds the keys to applications, fields and industries we’ve yet to even imagine.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Will Bezos bounce?

But the Amazon founder may already be residing in another state, Frame said.

Noel Frame.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#8220;I really think that Bezos has to be claiming residency elsewhere, which obviously has nothing to do with this proposal or anything else,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It’s just the choice that he made.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Even if Bezos does have one foot out the door, Frame said other taxpayers subject to the tax, such as Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, are too invested in their home state to leave.</p>\n<p>The Department of Revenue estimates the tax <a href=\"https://fnspublic.ofm.wa.gov/FNSPublicSearch/GetPDF?packageID=61674\">will raise about $2.5 billion</a> per year — which is less than the sum of the tax obligations of the state&#8217;s wealthiest people.</p>\n<p>Based on their current estimated net worths, just taxes collected from Bezos and Gates would exceed that estimate. According to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/jeff-bezos-would-owe-2-billion-in-state-taxes-under-washington-wealth-tax.html\">CNBC</a>, Bezos would owe about $2 billion annually, and Gates approximately $1.3 billion. <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/washington-state-wealth-tax/\">The Tax Foundation</a> noted that Gates, Bezos, Steve Ballmer and MacKenzie Scott would account for 97% of the tax&#8217;s revenue.</p>\n<p>The state&#8217;s estimates could be a sign that Bezos is already domiciled outside of Washington, or the Revenue Department may be factoring in the likelihood that some billionaires will move away.</p>\n<p>The federal government keeps information about taxpayers, including their state of residence, confidential. Not even the authors of the bill have access to that information. Frame is inferring that Bezos has already changed his state of residence because the estimates are low.</p>\n<p>If that&#8217;s the case, it could be a fairly recent move. Bezos voted in the November election in Washington, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jim_Brunner/status/1356994589429616641\">as The Seattle Times&#8217; Jim Brunner noted</a>. Complicating things further, Frame said a person&#8217;s voter registration is not part of the definition of residency used for the purposes of tax law.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the legislation&#8217;s authors included Bezos&#8217; net worth in the language of the bill, without naming him specifically.</p>\n<p>&#8220;According to Forbes, nine of the world&#8217;s wealthiest people reside in Washington state, and their individual wealth ranges from $2,700,000,000 to $179,000,000,000,&#8221; the bill says. The upper limit of that spectrum appears to reflect Bezos&#8217; net worth at the time the bill was drafted, though it <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22264856/jeff-bezos-worth-amazon-founder-ceo-193-billion-dollars\">has increased</a> since then.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Not raining on my parade b/c I don&#39;t think Bezos is included in the calculations. Can&#39;t confirm b/c its&#39; confidential tax payer data, but basic math of revenue estimates would suggest he is claiming residence elsewhere.

Tracking wealth of the ultra rich — especially when it is spread across stocks, LLCs, philanthropic efforts and other assets — is no easy task. Critics of wealth taxes also argue that the complexity makes them hard to enforce, eventually leading to repeal.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1406&amp;Year=2021&amp;Initiative=false\">bill in question</a> would levy a tax on monetary assets that belong to billionaires living in the state. The first $1 billion is exempt and any “extraordinary financial intangible assets” on top of that are taxed at 1%. Those assets include cash and cash equivalents, publicly-traded options, futures contracts, and stocks and bonds.</p>\n<p>Frame says the bill will make Washington&#8217;s tax code more equitable. The wealthiest households in the state currently pay about 3% of their income in taxes, while the poorest people pay 17.8%. It’s the largest differential in the U.S.</p>\n<p>Frame said it&#8217;s wrong to &#8220;continue to ask the people that can’t leave because they’re not as mobile&#8221; to shoulder the highest tax burden &#8220;just because somebody might leave.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We should just continue to ask them to pay a disproportionate share of community investments that we all rely on? That doesn’t seem right to me,&#8221; she said.</p>\n\n<p>The wealth tax proposal is still under consideration by the House Finance Committee and is scheduled for additional hearings. During its first hearing, several workers and executives from Washington&#8217;s booming tech industry <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2021/tech-workers-sound-off-washington-states-proposed-billionaire-tax-first-public-hearing/\">testified in favor of the bill</a>. Those who showed up to oppose the legislation most commonly cited the risk of billionaires moving out of the state rather than paying.</p>\n<p>Frame may be confident that the tax can withstand the departure of one or two billionaires but the Department of Revenue in <a href=\"https://fnspublic.ofm.wa.gov/FNSPublicSearch/GetPDF?packageID=61555\">a fiscal note</a> acknowledged that &#8220;revenues would be significantly impacted if one or more of these taxpayers were to move out-of-state or take other actions to reduce their wealth tax liability.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Seattle&#8217;s newest billionaire <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2021/seattles-newest-billionaire-says-tax-talk-will-drive-business-away-claims-seattle-freeze-garbage/\">certainly sees that as a likelihood</a>. Tanium co-founder and CEO Orion Hindawi left the San Francisco Area for Seattle a few months ago,<a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2020/tech-ceo-moves-9b-cybersecurity-companys-hq-seattle-area-says-san-francisco-not-city-20-years-ago/\"> bringing his $9 billion cybersecurity company</a> to the region along with him.</p>\n<p>“People can argue that it’s right or it’s wrong, but it’s somewhat irrelevant,” he <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2021/seattles-newest-billionaire-says-tax-talk-will-drive-business-away-claims-seattle-freeze-garbage/\">said in an interview</a> with Madrona Venture Group’s Matt McIlwain. “The question is actually do you want these people moving to your state or not?”</p>\n<aside class=\"callout clearfix\">\n<h4 class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2021/tech-workers-sound-off-washington-states-proposed-billionaire-tax-first-public-hearing/\">Tech workers sound off on Washington state’s proposed ‘billionaire tax’ at first public hearing</a></h4>\n</aside>\n<p>Despite those concerns, Hindawi said the wealth tax wouldn&#8217;t push him out of state. His decision to move to Seattle was driven by the city&#8217;s quality of life, not tax environment.</p>\n<p>A separate bill establishing a capital gains tax in Washington state <a href=\"https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2021/feb/17/new-version-of-capital-gains-tax-passes-washington/\">has been introduced</a> in the state legislature this session in addition to the wealth tax.</p>\n<p>The risk of billionaires pulling up stakes may not be quite as great in Washington as it is in states with an income tax. California and other states that have considered wealth taxes in the past must contend with the threat that they could lose income tax revenue from wealthy residents while going after new taxes.</p>\n<p>Because Washington does not have an income tax, it relies heavily on sales, business, and property taxes for revenue. Those who change their residency to avoid a wealth tax would likely still need a place to stay when returning to the state, so they may be inclined to hold (and continue paying taxes) on property.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s a lower risk in the sense that if they wanted to go somewhere else they’re going to get hit with all the taxes we don’t have here,&#8221; Frame said. &#8220;Whether you’re paying a wealth tax or going to go New York or California and pay capital gains and income tax, you’re still going to have tax liability.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Right now these folks have got a pretty good deal and working people in Washington are disproportionately shouldering that burden of funding community investments. At the end of the day, that’s what this is all about.&#8221;</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Study finds major disparities in vaccine clinical trials over the past decade</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.geekwire.com/2021/study-finds-major-disparities-vaccine-clinical-trials-past-decade/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 13:00:22 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Kellie Schmitt]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Health/Life Sciences]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[COVID-19 vaccine]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Fred Hutch]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[vaccine]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.geekwire.com/?p=605094</guid>\n\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img width=\"1260\" height=\"840\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Anthony-Jackson-at-Fred-Hutchs-vaccination-clinic-1260x840.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Anthony-Jackson-at-Fred-Hutchs-vaccination-clinic-1260x840.jpg 1260w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Anthony-Jackson-at-Fred-Hutchs-vaccination-clinic-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Anthony-Jackson-at-Fred-Hutchs-vaccination-clinic-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Anthony-Jackson-at-Fred-Hutchs-vaccination-clinic-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Anthony-Jackson-at-Fred-Hutchs-vaccination-clinic-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1260px) 100vw, 1260px\"><br>As data shows racial disparities in COVID-19 vaccine distribution, a new study has found racial and ethnic inequities across nearly a decade of U.S. vaccine trials.

The trials involved vaccines ranging from the flu to shingles and included 219,555 participants. They compared the number of people in each racial and ethnic group with U.S. census data from 2011 and 2018.</p>\n<p>White individuals were overrepresented while Black/African Americans, Hispanic and American Indian/Alaskan Natives were underrepresented, as were older adults. Asian and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander participants were more closely aligned with overall population percentages, and women were overrepresented.</p>\n<p>About 10% of vaccine trial participants in the study’s data were Black/African American — census data pegs that number at about 13%. Hispanic enrollment was 11.6% while that population was roughly 16 to 19% during the same period, according to census data. Meanwhile, white Americans represented 78% of trial participants compared to about 74 to 76% in census figures during that same period.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_605099\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-605099\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-605099 size-full-width\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-18-at-3.13.34-PM-630x310.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"310\" srcset=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-18-at-3.13.34-PM-630x310.png 630w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-18-at-3.13.34-PM-768x378.png 768w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-18-at-3.13.34-PM.png 832w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-605099\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dr. Michele Andrasik, a Fred Hutch scientist, and Dr. Steven Pergam, a Fred Hutch physician.

Even though every trial evaluated reported age and sex, just 58.3% included race and 34.3% for ethnicity.</p>\n<p>That missing information is noteworthy since the Food and Drug Administration <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/collection-race-and-ethnicity-data-clinical-trials\">recommends such data collection</a>, said <a href=\"https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/pergam-steven.html\">Dr. Steven Pergam</a>, a Fred Hutch physician specializing in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. Additionally, data gaps have also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/02/01/covid-vaccine-race-ethnicity-data/\">plagued COVID-19 vaccine distribution information nationwide</a>, he pointed out. It’s possible that participants might not answer race and ethnicity questions or that study interviewers are unable to visually discern one’s race and ethnicity.</p>\n<p>“Some people feel uncomfortable asking people about race and ethnicity, so that discomfort is a barrier,” Andrasik said.</p>\n<aside class=\"callout clearfix\">\n<h4 class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2020/can-vaccinated-people-still-transmit-covid-19-answer-key-herd-immunity-research-finds/\">Can vaccinated people still transmit COVID-19? The answer is key for herd immunity, research finds</a></h4>\n</aside>\n<p>Researchers recommended that racial and ethnic data gathering should be enforced and diversity targets that reflect the population should be included for all vaccine trials of important infections. They also urged that enrollment target populations at the greatest risk of infection or mortality, such as older adults with the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>Creating vaccine trials that reflect the overall community can have far-ranging impacts, such as countering vaccine hesitancy and safety concerns.</p>\n<p>“Based on past exclusion and maltreatment, vaccine hesitancy and lack of trust in the medical establishment may be more prevalent across minority groups, making inclusion even more important,” the study&#8217;s authors wrote.</p>\n<p>Steps can be taken early in the process that prioritize inclusion — <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-vaccines-diversity-idUKKBN29X1KA\">a goal of the COVID vaccine trials</a>. That outreach comes before the trials start, with active involvement in the community and relationship building.</p>\n<p>Underrepresentation can be most apparent in the later stages of vaccine development, according to the study. Costs combined with rapid enrollment goals may be a reason.</p>\n<p>It’s important to set specific targets for participants’ race and ethnicity that reflect the populations, researchers said.</p>\n<p>“When you know who you have to recruit, it’s amazing how it will happen,” Andrasik said. “If you are mindful and include the community early and often, this can happen.”</p>\n<p>Andrasik experienced the importance of early inclusion in her own experience with the COVID-19 vaccine. She had many conversations with Black relatives and friends, many of whom expressed their discomfort and fear surrounding vaccination. In long conversations, she shared information about the inclusion efforts and the diverse populations involved in the COVID-19 trials.</p>\n<p>“Then I got pictures on my phone of them getting vaccinated,” she said. “It was quite wonderful.”</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Redfin will pay $608M to acquire RentPath, owner of Rentals.com, Rent.com and ApartmentGuide</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.geekwire.com/2021/redfin-agrees-acquire-rentpath-608-million-owner-rentals-com-rent-com-apartmentguide/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 12:18:07 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[John Cook]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tech]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[M&A]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Real Estate]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Redfin]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.geekwire.com/?p=605255</guid>\n\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img width=\"1260\" height=\"840\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0975-Summit-Day-1-2018-1260x840.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0975-Summit-Day-1-2018-1260x840.jpg 1260w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0975-Summit-Day-1-2018-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0975-Summit-Day-1-2018-630x420.jpg 630w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0975-Summit-Day-1-2018.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1260px) 100vw, 1260px\"><br>Redfin is making a major push into the residential home rental market, announcing Friday morning that it is paying $608 million in cash for Atlanta-based RentPath.

Since its founding in 2004, Redfin has acquired only one other company: Walk Score.</p>\n<p>Analysts at Wedbush Securities said Redfin&#8217;s move into rental listings is &#8220;very complimentary&#8221; to its core business of home-buying and selling, adding that the deal represents &#8220;strong value&#8221; and will be a significant boost to Redfin&#8217;s traffic.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We view Redfin&#8217;s intention to acquire RentPath as a sound strategic move that enhances its offering in the near-term and especially over the long-term,&#8221; Wedbush wrote in a research note Friday.</p>\n<p>Possible regulatory headwinds await. In December, RentPath <a href=\"https://www.rentpath.com/blog/rentpath-terminates-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-costar-group/\">terminated an agreement</a> to be acquired by CoStar Group <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/201-0061/costar-group-rentpath-holdings-matter\">following a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit</a> to block the deal, citing potential harm to consumers due to consolidation in the residential rental market. That acquisition, originally <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/costar-in-talks-to-buy-apartment-search-firm-rentpath-for-500-million-11581454921?mod=article_inline\">announced</a> in February 2020, valued RentPath at $588 million and came as the company entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>“RentPath has made significant progress and is on an upward trajectory despite an undoubtedly challenging 2020,&#8221; said Stephen Spencer, Managing Director at Houlihan Lokey and advisor to RentPath’s lenders in a press release at the time of the canceled CoStar deal. &#8220;The market for real estate technology businesses continues to be very strong as recent M&amp;A transactions have highlighted.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, CoStar is pushing back on a $60 million break-up fee that RentPath said was owed after the deal fell apart, <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/national/2021/01/05/costar-fights-60m-break-up-fee-after-scuttled-rentpath-deal/\">according to The Real Deal.</a></p>\n<p>In order for Redfin&#8217;s acquisition to move forward, the FTC and bankruptcy court will need to green light the deal. In a conference call Friday morning, Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman said he didn&#8217;t anticipate the same regulatory scrutiny that CoStar encountered since Redfin is relatively new to the rental listing space.</p>\n<p>Redfin is best known for its home buying and selling services, but apartment rentals is an attractive slice of the home market that the Seattle company has not yet touched in a big way.</p>\n<p>&#8220;RentPath has more than 20,000 apartment buildings on its rental websites, and grew its traffic more than 25% last year,&#8221; said Kelman in a statement. &#8220;We can almost double that audience, as one in five of Redfin.com&#8217;s 40+ million monthly visitors also wants to see homes for rent. Together with RentPath, we can create an online destination for every North American to find a home.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We love you RentPath!

Fonseca who serves as an adviser to TPG, one of the private equity owners of RentPath, has strong ties to Seattle,</p>\n<p>He&#8217;s the former Chief Commercial Officer at Expedia, where he served for more than 19 years. Before that, he worked at Microsoft for many years, working alongside Zillow Group CEO Rich Barton to spin out Expedia into a separate company in 1995. He&#8217;s also a board member at Alaska Airlines.</p>\n<p>The deal comes three days after Redfin&#8217;s cross-town rival <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2021/zillow-group-will-pay-500m-acquire-home-touring-tech-company-showingtime/\">Zillow Group made its own big purchase</a> in the real estate market, buying home touring company ShowingTime for $500 million. In addition to showcasing homes for sale, Zillow also operates a rental marketplace.</p>\n<p>In Friday&#8217;s conference call, Kelman specifically cited competition with Zillow in rentals, and tipped his hat to <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2013/zillow-paying-50m-buy-yorks-streeteasy-files-raise-cash/\">Zillow&#8217;s 2013 StreetEasy acquisition</a> which gave it a major beachhead in the lucrative New York rental market. Given that deal, Kelman said that New York would be a tough market for Redfin to crack, and that they&#8217;d likely focus attention elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Bigger picture, Kelman said that Redfin needed to be in the apartment and home rental business, since it is a typical entry point for consumers and serves as a stepping stone to eventual home ownership. He added that it would have likely taken four years for Redfin to build out the rentals inventory on its own, and because it lagged larger competitors they needed to buy their way into the market.</p>\n<p>Redfin&#8217;s stock has more than doubled in the past year, and the company now boasts a market value of $8.8 billion.

It will also grow the <i>Destiny 2 </i>universe into other media and plans to develop at least one new intellectual property.</p>\n<p>This marks another big paradigm shift from Bungie, which made a risky switch from a third-party developer to an independent self-publisher <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2019/future-destiny-2-newly-independent-bungie-unveils-plans-flagship-game/\">back in 2019</a>. As part of that move, it spent a lot of time reworking <i>Destiny 2</i>&#8216;s systems and features, which included making it free to play and bringing it to new storefronts such as Steam.</p>\n<p>So far, that seems to have paid off. Following the November release of its latest expansion, <i>Beyond Light, </i><a href=\"https://mmo-population.com/r/destiny2\">independent MMO population trackers</a> estimate that <i>Destiny 2 </i>has a stable and growing population of around 30 million players, with around 83,000 <a href=\"https://steamcharts.com/app/1085660\">playing the PC version</a> on a typical day.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The past several years have been a time of tremendous growth and opportunity for Bungie,&#8221; Bungie CEO Pete Parsons said in a statement.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe title=\"Destiny 2: Beyond Light - Launch Trailer\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cthLUnEqT5k?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The announcement sets the stage for Bungie to take a big step up in overall industry visibility in the next few years. What&#8217;s really gotten the gaming enthusiast community&#8217;s attention is Bungie&#8217;s offhand mention of wanting to make something new in the relatively near future.</p>\n<p>The initial release phrases it as &#8220;plans to bring at least one new IP to market before 2025.&#8221; Bungie&#8217;s track record as a company suggests it&#8217;ll be a surreal action game in a science fiction setting such as <i>Marathon </i>or<i> Halo</i>, but anything is possible.</p>\n<p>Bungie began work on its new headquarters last month, with an estimated completion date in the fall of 2022. The new facility, designed by Seattle-based international architecture firm NBBJ, is planned to be a 208,000 square-foot building — up from its current 84,000 square-foot location — centered around a system of collaborative &#8220;neighborhoods.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bungie employs nearly 1,000 people, according to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/bungie\">LinkedIn</a>.</p>\n<p>Two new external members, Trace Harris and Pamela Kaufman, have joined Bungie&#8217;s board as part of the expansion. Harris is a New York-based finance and strategy executive with a board seat at Altair Engineering, following a 13-year stint as a senior executive at the French media conglomerate Vivendi. Kaufman is the president of global consumer products for ViacomCBS, and previously spent 10 years as an executive vice president of marketing for the Nickelodeon network.</p>\n<p>In addition, Bungie has internally appointed Mark Noseworthy and Luke Smith as vice president and executive creative director of the <i>Destiny </i>Universe, respectively. They will &#8220;oversee and prepare for the expansion into additional media.&#8221; Justin Truman has been appointed as the general manager of <i>Destiny 2 </i>game development.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>NASA&#8217;s Perseverance rover touches down to start years-long search for life on Mars</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.geekwire.com/2021/nasas-perseverance-rover-touches-start-years-long-search-life-mars/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2021 21:10:54 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Alan Boyle]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Space]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[2020 Mars rover]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ingenuity]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[mars]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[NASA]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[NASA JPL]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Perseverance rover]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.geekwire.com/?p=605005</guid>\n\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img width=\"1260\" height=\"912\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210219-mars2-1260x912.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"Perseverance rover on Mars\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210219-mars2-1260x912.jpg 1260w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210219-mars2-768x556.jpg 768w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210219-mars2-630x456.jpg 630w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210219-mars2.jpg 1439w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1260px) 100vw, 1260px\"><br>NASA&#8217;s Perseverance rover touched down on Mars today and began a mission that&#8217;s meant to store up evidence of past life on Mars, after a trip that came to a climax with seven minutes of delicious terror. &#8220;Touchdown confirmed!

Perseverance safely on the surface of Mars, ready to begin seeking the signs of past life,&#8221; lead controller Swati Mohan declared at 12:55 p.m. PT.</p>\n<p>The end of Perseverance&#8217;s seven-month, 300 million-mile journey played out like a radio drama. Due to limited bandwidth and an 11-minute delay in receiving signals, there was no live video of the landing. But thanks to internet links, millions of people could listen in as Mohan called out the milestones over a live stream from NASA&#8217;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.</p>\n<p>A socially distanced cadre of controllers at JPL applauded, screamed and exchanged fist bumps after the touchdown. Moments later, the first black-and-white picture from the rover&#8217;s hazard avoidance cameras was displayed on a giant screen.</p>\n<p>Engineers at Aerojet Rocketdyne&#8217;s facility in Redmond, Wash., played a critical role in setting up what was arguably the riskiest phase of the descent.</p>\n<p>After the spacecraft slowed down from a speed of 12,000 mph and deployed its parachute, a &#8220;sky crane&#8221; platform fired up eight Aerojet thrusters. While the platform hovered 65 feet above the surface of Jezero Crater, the rover was lowered to the surface on the end of a set of cables. Once the rover&#8217;s six wheels touched the surface, the cables were cut, and the platform blasted itself away to a crash landing.</p>\n<p>The landing sequence was basically a rerun of the routine for 2012&#8217;s Mars Curiosity rover mission. &#8220;It seemed like a wild idea at the time, when Curiosity did it, but it worked flawlessly,&#8221; Bill Cahill, project manager for Aerojet&#8217;s Redmond operation, said during a webcast presented by Seattle&#8217;s Museum of Flight.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe title=\"7 Minutes to Mars: NASA&#039;s Perseverance Rover Attempts Most Dangerous Landing Yet\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M4tdMR5HLtg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Over the eight and a half years since Curiosity landed, the Perseverance team developed a navigation system that could capture views of the terrain beneath the spacecraft and adjust its descent accordingly.</p>\n<p>JPL engineer Allen Chen, who led the team for entry, descent and landing, said during a post-touchdown news briefing that the system helped the rover dodge rugged areas that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dr_ThomasZ/status/1362545736467046405\">would have posed significant hazards for the mission</a>. &#8220;<span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">We</span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">are</span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">in</span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">a</span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">nice</span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">flat</span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">spot,&#8221; he said. &#8220;T</span><span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">he</span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">vehicle</span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">is</span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">only</span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">tilted</span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">by</span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">about</span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">1.2</span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">degrees.</span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">So</span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">we</span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">did</span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">successfully</span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">find</span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">that</span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">parking</span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">lot</span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">and</span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">have</span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">a</span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">safe</span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word\">rover on the ground.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>The 1-ton Perseverance rover makes use of Curiosity&#8217;s basic chassis design, but the $2.7 billion mission has a much more ambitious agenda.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It really is the beginning of a new era, in the sense that we&#8217;re going from exploration &#8230; to the sample return phase,&#8221; said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA&#8217;s associate administrator for space science.</p>\n<p>In addition to its on-site study of Martian geology, Perseverance will drill out samples of Martian soil and rock, store them in capsules and save them up for later retrieval. If all goes according to plan, a series of future robotic probes will bring those samples back to Earth in the early 2030s for detailed lab studies.</p>\n<h4 class=\"callout clearfix\"><strong>Pictures or it didn&#8217;t happen:</strong> <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/multimedia/raw-images/\" target=\"new\" rel=\"noopener\">Check out raw images from NASA&#8217;s Perseverance rover</a></h4>\n<p>The samples will be selected based on their potential to reveal whether Mars harbored life in its distant past, and perhaps whether remnants of life could still endure beneath the Red Planet&#8217;s surface.</p>\n<p>“Are we alone in this sort of vast cosmic desert, just flying through space, or is life much more common? &#8230; We don&#8217;t know the answers yet,&#8221; JPL&#8217;s Ken Williford, the mission&#8217;s deputy project scientist, said during a pre-landing briefing. &#8220;We’re really on the verge of being able to potentially answer these enormous questions.”</p>\n<p>Jezero Crater was chosen as the target area because its geology suggests it was flooded with water billions of years ago, providing a potentially hospitable environment for microbes. Even though Mars is much colder and drier than it was back then, it&#8217;s possible that chemical traces of past biological activity or fossilized traces of microbes could endure within the rock.</p>\n<p>In addition to drilling samples, Perseverance is equipped with a suite of scientific instruments capable of surveying the chemical composition of its surroundings in unprecedented detail, including the first zoom camera ever sent to Mars. For that reason, Lori Glaze, the director of NASA&#8217;s planetary science division, refers to the rover as &#8220;our first mobile astrobiologist&#8221; on Mars.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe title=\"First Look | NASA Mars Landing: Inside the Mission\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6EFjiR0Z6U0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>But Perseverance is more than an astrobiologist: It&#8217;s carrying a deployable <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2020/nasa-takes-high-school-students-suggestion-gives-mars-helicopter-new-name-ingenuity/\">mini-helicopter dubbed Ingenuity</a> that&#8217;s due to take a series of test flights during an early phase of the mission, becoming the first aerodynamic flying vehicle to soar over the surface of another planet.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is really a Wright Brothers moment,&#8221; Western Washington University&#8217;s Melissa Rice, a member of the Perseverance science team, said before today&#8217;s landing.</p>\n<p>Yet another experiment, <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/instruments/moxie/\">known as MOXIE</a>, is designed to test techniques for converting the carbon dioxide in Mars&#8217; thin atmosphere to oxygen. Such a technology could come in handy for future explorers who&#8217;ll need reserves of breathable air and rocket propellant.</p>\n<p>Perseverance isn&#8217;t the Red Planet&#8217;s only new arrival: Thanks to a propitious orbital alignment, robotic spacecraft supported by <a href=\"https://cosmiclog.com/2021/02/10/chinas-mars-probe-enters-orbit-scoring-another-first/\">China</a> and the <a href=\"https://cosmiclog.com/2021/02/09/arab-orbiter-reaches-mars-kicking-off-a-robot-invasion/\">United Arab Emirates</a> were <a href=\"https://cosmiclog.com/2020/07/17/its-the-summer-of-mars-check-your-red-planet-iq/\">launched last July</a> just before Perseverance&#8217;s liftoff and entered Martian orbit earlier this month. China&#8217;s Tianwen-1 orbiter is due to send a lander and rover down to the surface in the May-June time frame.</p>\n<p>Will such probes still be at work when humans are sent to Mars? In Perseverance&#8217;s case, that&#8217;s not a bad bet. NASA has set its primary mission to last at least one full Martian year, or nearly two Earth years. But thanks to its plutonium-fueled power system, the rover could theoretically stay in operation for a decade or more.</p>\n<p>NASA&#8217;s acting administrator, Steve Jurczyk, said he received a congratulatory phone call from President Joe Biden after the landing. &#8220;His first words were, &#8216;Congratulations, man&#8217; — and I knew it was him,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Jurczyk marveled at today&#8217;s success. &#8220;What an amazing team, to work through all the adversity and all the challenges that go with landing a rover on Mars, plus the challenges of COVID,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Just an amazing accomplishment.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although the Perseverance team was generally diligent about mask-wearing and social distancing, Zurbuchen acknowledged half-jokingly that some rules were bent when the rover touched down. &#8220;I had to hug some people,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Sorry for that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to all the science instruments, Perseverance <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2020/nasas-perseverance-rover-will-go-mars-monument-covid-19-medical-teams/\">carries a plaque that pays tribute to medical workers</a> and their efforts to quell the coronavirus pandemic, as well as three microchips that are etched with the names of <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8634/109-million-names-now-aboard-nasas-perseverance-mars-rover/\">nearly 11 million people</a> who responded to a &#8220;Send Your Name to Mars&#8221; campaign.

GeekWire <strong><a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2016/the-united-states-of-amazon/\">has been tracking data from the page for five years</a></strong>, and we filled in the gaps using <strong><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201028205348/https://www.aboutamazon.com/investing-in-the-u-s\">snapshots captured by the Internet Archive</a></strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Reality check:</strong> Amazon is growing so rapidly that its official numbers are often quickly out of date. (The company puts a &#8220;+&#8221; sign by each employment number in recognition of this fact.) By Amazon&#8217;s official count, for example, it has 25 fulfillment and sortation centers and 19 delivery stations in California, which would be the most in the nation. However, <a href=\"https://www.mwpvl.com/html/amazon_com.html\"><strong>data maintained by logistics consultancy MWPVL International</strong></a> shows more than 30 Amazon fulfillment and sortation centers in California, and as many as 60 delivery stations in the state.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-604994\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/amzn-employment.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"441\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Global context:</strong> Amazon<a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-now-employs-nearly-1-3-million-people-worldwide-adding-500000-workers-2020/\"><strong> employed nearly 1.3 million people worldwide</strong></a> as of the end of 2020, growing by 500,000 people in one year.

While it&#8217;s true that the sheer wealth and quality of PS4 exclusives played a big part in making Sony&#8217;s console reach record sales numbers, player expectations have changed quite a lot.

Whereas on the M1 powered Macs, it displays a red window with a message &#8220;You did it!&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Red Canary has suggested some steps to figure out if your Mac is under threat or not, but these steps are not specific for detecting Silver Sparrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Look for a process that appears to be PlistBuddy executing in conjunction with a command-line containing the following: LaunchAgents and RunAtLoad and true. This analytic helps us find multiple macOS malware families establishing LaunchAgent persistence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Look for a process that appears to be sqlite3 executing in conjunction with a<br>command line that contains: LSQuarantine. This analytic helps us find multiple macOS malware families manipulating or searching metadata for downloaded files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Look for a process that appears to be curl executing in conjunction with a command line that contains: s3.amazonaws.com. This analytic helps us find multiple macOS malware families using S3 buckets for distribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s just been a few months since Apple introduced its latest lineup of ARM-powered Macs. Since then, it has been under attack by two threats, one discovered just a few days ago, and now another one attacking macOS without its true potential being known.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, Apple does not forget its commitment to safety as the Cupertino giant has told <a href=\"https://in.mashable.com/tech/20436/new-malware-silver-sparrow-is-targeting-both-intel-and-m1-macs\" class=\"rank-math-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mashable</a> that it has retracted the developer accounts&#8217; certificates to sign the packages.

But by the looks of it, iPhone 12 mini has seen a bad fate and with dwindling sales results, rumours say that the 12 mini might soon get cut from the lineup. So what is Apple doing planning for an iPhone 13 mini? Let&#8217;s clear it out. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/d-x611SLw3EYEGPLd1BGjY-Gjws=/868x488/2021/01/21/6df85ab8-3abd-4d06-acc0-8fd1580faea9/iphone13-rumors-00027.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>iPhone 13 rumours are gaining momentum and we intend to address all of them in future articles! Courtesy: CNET</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 13 mini &#8212; Is it viable?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 12 mini debuted alongside bigger iPhone 12 and 12 Pro models. It was squarely aimed at people who wanted to move up to a full screen display from the larger iPhones without giving up on the size of say the 6, 6s, 7 and the likes. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1019\" height=\"621\" src=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/iphone-12-mini-vs-iphone-7.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-144634\" srcset=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/iphone-12-mini-vs-iphone-7.png 1019w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/iphone-12-mini-vs-iphone-7-300x183.png 300w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/iphone-12-mini-vs-iphone-7-768x468.png 768w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/iphone-12-mini-vs-iphone-7-696x424.png 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1019px) 100vw, 1019px\" /><figcaption>iPhone 12 mini as seen beside an iPhone 7. Courtesy: iPhoneHacks</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However, things aren&#8217;t going according to plan. The iPhone 12 mini sales have been really poor. Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (<a href=\"https://www.cirpllc.com/\" class=\"rank-math-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CIRP</a>)&nbsp;cites the sales to be <strong>just 5%</strong> of the total sales. JP Morgan even reported that Apple might cut production of the 12 minis altogether. So why make an iPhone 13 mini?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2021/02/iphone-13-renders.jpg\" alt=\"The iPhone 13 lineup rendered on XDA Developers. iPhone 13 mini is the right most device here.\" /><figcaption>The iPhone 13 lineup rendered on XDA Developers. iPhone 13 mini is the right most device here.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has always pushed for compact phones, which are truly portable &#8212; which is why cell phones were originally conceived to be. Apple resisted big phones even when the competition pushed for it and they convinced huge bases of people to grab smaller iPhones, which despite of their small size offered performance at par with the flagships and in some cases one-upping them as well. The same intentions gave birth to the SE and eventually the iPhone 12 mini. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, despite its diminishing market volume we can expect an iPhone 13 mini. Here&#8217;s why.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why we think there will be an iPhone 13 mini</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has been talkative about the positioning of their smaller devices to be clearly directed to people with smaller hands or a simple taste in smaller phones. The evidence lies in the existence of the iPhone SE which was in fact upgraded in 2020. The iPhone SE 2020 was essentially an iPhone 11 squeezed into an iPhone 8 body. With affordable pricing and great specs, it was a hit. The icing on the cake &#8212; it often was sold with sweet deals by various sellers making it even tougher to falter with.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202102/iPhone_13_Pro_render_1_1200x768.jpeg?NqKg_cggUJ4K1GJCT0mKY8PwhSsnEwqy&amp;size=770:433\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>iPhone 13 mini will come in various colour options to appeal to a wide set of audience.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Believe it or not, the iPhone SE could be considered to be a nail in the coffin of the iPhone 12 mini (i.e. as and when it dies off the Apple production line). The iPhone SE clearly had some amazing internals and a lucrative price going for it. And hence, the &#8216;small&#8217; phone market was already catered for. Launching another smartphone aimed at an audience that clearly was satisfied didn&#8217;t play out as Apple expected it to. Although the 12 mini would trump the SE any day, there were no takers for it especially with the $300 headroom over the SE. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gsmarena_031-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"Small hands require small iPhones.

Apple is already planning to place the rumoured device, which for now is being called to be the iPhone SE Plus. If that stands to be true, the current iPhone SE shall remain untouched and the larger iPhone SE Plus creating a space in between for an iPhone 13 mini. The iPhone 13 mini could be looked at to be a successor to the iPhone SE. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Can We Expect From the iPhone 13 mini?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 13 might carry forward with the same body which means it will retain the same compact body style. On the front, it might continue using a 5.4&#8243; Super Retina XDR display at 476 PPI. The rear of the device might get a redesigned camera modules with a blacked-out glass under the improved camera optics lie. The iPhone 13 mini will overall look similar to the outgoing iPhone 12 mini with slab-like edges and a glass and metal combination design. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"959\" height=\"618\" src=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/960x0.jpg\" alt=\"The camera module on the back will see new blacked out glass &quot;technology&quot; and the cameras might be improved for 2021.\" class=\"wp-image-144633\" srcset=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/960x0.jpg 959w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/960x0-300x193.jpg 300w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/960x0-768x495.jpg 768w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/960x0-696x449.jpg 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 959px) 100vw, 959px\" /><figcaption>The camera module on the back will see new blacked out glass &#8220;technology&#8221; and the cameras might be improved for 2021. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside cosmetic changes, the iPhone 13 mini would share the flagship grade processor for the entire line up. Improvements made to what can now be called the &#8220;A15&#8221; chipset will benefit the iPhone 13 line up with better performance. Some sources say that the iPhone 13 line up could be the first to use 6G even. However, it is sure that the iPhone 13 mini will come with 5G, WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.0 and NFC as standard. Apple might ditch the lightning port and shift to the MagSafe charger which would sell one extra Apple accessory and make you spend a little more.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/apple-is-working-on-a-magsafe-battery-pack/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Apple Working on a Magsafe Battery Pack for iPhone 12</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 13 mini will ship with the iOS 15 update built into it which in turn would fetch the device with some new software features. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 12 mini launched alongside the 2020 iPhone 12 models features a slab like design with metal rails and glass front/back. It features a 5.4&#8243; Super Retina XDR display with 476 PPI. It is powered by the 5nm A14 Bionic chipset and supports 5G, Bluetooth 5, WiFi 6 and NFC. It is also compatible with MagSafe accessories.

The more powerful &#8216;ASIC A&#8217; version will be targeting 230W, with the &#8216;ASIC B&#8217; targeting 189 W. Overall the 6700 XT GPU is expected to perform upwards of 20-25% of what the <a aria-label=\"last-gen RX 5700 XT did (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/amd-radeon-rx-5700-vs-nvidia-geforce-rtx-2060-super-which-graphics-card-should-you-buy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">last-gen RX 5700 XT offered</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By now we&#8217;ve known for a while that the RX 6700 XT will come with <a aria-label=\"12GB of GDDR6 memory (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/amd-radeon-rx-6700-leaked-specs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">12 GB of GDDR6 memory</a>, and that seemingly won&#8217;t change with the different variations. What&#8217;s more interesting is the alleged RX 6700 launch in April, which will come with a 6 GB VRAM buffer. That is still a little lower than what we expect from a 70-class graphics card, but at the higher clock speeds of RDNA 2, it might make up with competitive performance. Just to compare, NVIDIA&#8217;s recent GeForce RTX 3070 comes with 8 GB of GDDR6 memory, and even the lower end <a href=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-fe-review/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"RTX 3060 Ti has the same amount (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">RTX 3060 Ti has the same amount</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-review-big-navi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-RX-6800-XT-Front-2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT Front 2\" class=\"wp-image-140943\" srcset=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-RX-6800-XT-Front-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-RX-6800-XT-Front-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-RX-6800-XT-Front-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-RX-6800-XT-Front-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-RX-6800-XT-Front-2-696x464.jpg 696w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-RX-6800-XT-Front-2-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-RX-6800-XT-Front-2-1920x1280.jpg 1920w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-RX-6800-XT-Front-2-150x100.jpg 150w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-RX-6800-XT-Front-2.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-review-big-navi/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Going by our previous reports, the RX 6700 series should still offer great performance if they launch alongside FidelityFX Super Resolution, which is also <a href=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/amd-fidelityfx-super-resolution-march-update/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"slated to release in March (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">slated to release in March</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>AMD is yet to officially announce anything regarding the RX 6700 series, but it looks like we won&#8217;t have to wait long for that. </p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://www.techquila.co.in/amd-radeon-rx-6700-xt-different-configurations/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:content url=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XffTdLPaGOg\" medium=\"video\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\">\n\t\t\t<media:player>https://www.youtube.com/embed/XffTdLPaGOg</media:player>\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"plain\">AMD Radeon RX 6700 Reportedly Coming in April, 6700 XT Launching With 2 Variants</media:title>\n\t\t\t<media:description type=\"html\"><![CDATA[A new report shows AMD may be working on 2 different configurations of the upcoming Radeon RX 6700 XT, with the base RX 6700 launching in April.]]></media:description>\n\t\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Radeon-RX-6700-Leaked-Render.jpg\" />\n\t\t\t<media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Top 5 Smartphones Under INR 20,000 in India – February 2021</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.techquila.co.in/top-5-smartphones-under-inr-20000/</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<comments>https://www.techquila.co.in/top-5-smartphones-under-inr-20000/#respond</comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Abhinav Kaustubh]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 20 Feb 2021 10:58:41 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Buying Guides]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Mobile Guides]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[best smartphones]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Mi 10i 5G]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Moto G 5G]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Narzo 20]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Poco X3]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Realme X7]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Top 5 Smartphones]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.techquila.co.in/?p=144577</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[These days Indian market is getting overcrowded with midrange smartphones with overwhelming specifications that you’d expect from a high-priced smartphone.

The <a href=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/poco-x3-120hz-snapdragon-732g-launch/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Poco X3 </a>offers some of the high-end features, including a 120Hz display and Snapdragon 732 backed up by a behemoth 6000mAh battery. The Poco X3 is quite a good deal for its price, considering that Poco&#8217;s version of MIUI doesn&#8217;t come up with ads, but it does offer MIUI core features.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Realme X7</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"595\" src=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-04-at-11.03.54-PM-1-1024x595.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-144581\" srcset=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-04-at-11.03.54-PM-1-1024x595.jpg 1024w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-04-at-11.03.54-PM-1-300x174.jpg 300w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-04-at-11.03.54-PM-1-768x446.jpg 768w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-04-at-11.03.54-PM-1-696x404.jpg 696w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-04-at-11.03.54-PM-1-1068x620.jpg 1068w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-04-at-11.03.54-PM-1.jpg 1422w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Realme X7 </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>Price: </strong></strong><a href=\"https://www.flipkart.com/realme-x7-space-silver-128-gb/p/itmdcd4f14ec55d1?pid=MOBFZGWX6SXPYRBU&amp;lid=LSTMOBFZGWX6SXPYRBUOVRJW0&amp;marketplace=FLIPKART&amp;srno=s_1_1&amp;otracker=search&amp;otracker1=search&amp;fm=SEARCH&amp;iid=0c9a9179-e4c7-4fba-a98a-2585ef486ed5.MOBFZGWX6SXPYRBU.SEARCH&amp;ppt=sp&amp;ppn=sp&amp;ssid=cs5qf8vq7dzsn1mo1613817869664&amp;qH=8237f249eb7d2453\" class=\"rank-math-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><strong>₹19,999 – 6/128 GB</strong></strong> </a>|<a href=\"https://www.flipkart.com/realme-x7-space-silver-128-gb/p/itmdcd4f14ec55d1?pid=MOBFZGWX6SXPYRBU&amp;lid=LSTMOBFZGWX6SXPYRBUOVRJW0&amp;marketplace=FLIPKART&amp;srno=s_1_1&amp;otracker=search&amp;otracker1=search&amp;fm=SEARCH&amp;iid=0c9a9179-e4c7-4fba-a98a-2585ef486ed5.MOBFZGWX6SXPYRBU.SEARCH&amp;ppt=sp&amp;ppn=sp&amp;ssid=cs5qf8vq7dzsn1mo1613817869664&amp;qH=8237f249eb7d2453\" class=\"rank-math-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> <strong><strong>₹21,999 – 8/128 GB</strong></strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>MediaTek Dimensity 800U Processor</strong></li><li><strong>6/8GB RAM | 128GB ROM</strong></li><li><strong>6.43-inch Full HD+ AMOLED Display</strong></li><li><strong>64MP + 8MP + 2MP | 16MP Front Camera</strong></li><li><strong>4310 mAh Battery</strong></li><li><strong>50W Fast Charging </strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Realme X7 is powered by Mediatek&#8217;s Dimensity 8000U SoC on par with Qualcomm&#8217;s top-tier Snapdragon 8 series chipsets, and the Dimensity 8000U brings 5G onboard.

The flip was immediately followed by a global period of upheaval and chaos. A lot seems to have changed due to this relatively lesser-known event in our history. According to the radiocarbon preserved in ancient tree rings, the flip was the direct cause of centuries’ worth of climate breakdown, mass extinctions, and changes in the behavior of humans and animals alike. This reverse in polarity deserves much more attention than we are giving it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image.jpg\" alt=\"The magnetic switch is recorded in the tree rings of the remains.\" class=\"wp-image-144533\" srcset=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image.jpg 800w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-696x464.jpg 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /><figcaption>The magnetic switch is recorded in the tree rings of the remains.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Named as the Adamas Transitional Geomagnetic Event, or the Adams Event, after <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Douglas Adams</a>, who in one of his books had declared 42 to be the answer to life, the Universe, and everything. This marks the first time that researchers have been able to precisely date an event like the magnetic pole switch and study its immediate aftermath. The primary source of data for this discovery is the remains of the ancient New Zealand kauri trees, which have been preserved for over 40,000 years. The remains of the trees helped the scientists measure the spike in atmospheric radiocarbon levels following the magnetic field&#8217;s collapse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most recent period of pole reversal is known as the Laschamp event. The formal name of such an event is the geomagnetic excursion. It is characterized by the planet’s magnetic poles briefly swapping places before returning to their original positions. The latest one happened about 41,000 years ago and lasted for about 800 years. What effects it had on life back then was unclear, so researchers jumped on the opportunity to study the remains that were unearthed of an ancient tree that had been alive at that time. The atmospheric activity recorded in its growth rings proved to be an invaluable source for data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Radiocarbon, or <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-14#:~:text=Carbon%2D14%20(14C),archaeological%2C%20geological%20and%20hydrogeological%20samples.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">carbon-14</a> present in the remains&#8217; rings, helped us figure out the cosmic activity at that time. As the particular form of carbon is only formed in the upper atmosphere., researchers can study the trace amounts found in trees living at the time to figure out how much cosmic radiation Earth was receiving. This means that during an event when the Earth’s magnetic field was weakened, the plants should record more cosmic radiation. This holds true for the Laschamp event as the trees show that the Earth’s magnetic field was at its weakest leading up to the switch event.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/maxresdefault-2-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-144534\" srcset=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/maxresdefault-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/maxresdefault-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/maxresdefault-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/maxresdefault-2-696x392.jpg 696w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/maxresdefault-2-1068x601.jpg 1068w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/maxresdefault-2.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>The tree rings increase with the tree&#8217;s age.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The weakened magnetic field must have triggered climate change as radiation from outer space could easily ionize the earth’s atmosphere. This would have led to change in the behaviour of animals across the world. Interestingly this event coincides with some of our oldest cave art. This leads some researchers to suspect that the harsh climate would have forced humans back into caves and prompted the other behavioral changes from that era. However, all of this is mostly speculation, and we need to wait more to see what the larger scientific community thinks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further Reading:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/intel-12th-gen-alder-lake-might-beat-amd-ryzen/\">Intel 12th Gen Alder Lake-S CPUs Might Come Out On Top of AMD Zen 4 With 20% IPC Gain, To Release in December</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/why-cancer-in-elephants-is-rare/\">Why Cancer in Elephants is Rare</a></li></ul>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://www.techquila.co.in/magnetic-field-flipped/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Android 12 Developer Preview: What&#8217;s in Store</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.techquila.co.in/android-12-developer-preview/</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<comments>https://www.techquila.co.in/android-12-developer-preview/#respond</comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Abhinav Kaustubh]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 19:52:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Mobile]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Google]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.techquila.co.in/?p=144522</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[It&#8217;s that time of year again, and to be clear, I&#8217;m speaking about the arrival of Android&#8217;s next iteration, the Android 12.

Notifications look more modern than before, and quick settings panel background and notification now have a translucent background. A tiny snooze icon on the message notification&#8217;s bottom-right allows you to snooze the notification for 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or an hour two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The quick settings panel has received some treatment; tiles now show a light blue color instead of gray when not in use. There&#8217;s no change in the icon&#8217;s design, but they have been reshuffled; DND and Battery Saver toggles are now on the first card, and Mobile Data has been pushed back to the second page, while GPS has found its way out of the quick settings panel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Sharing Your WiFi Password is Now Easier</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Android 11 eased things quite a bit when it came to sharing WiFi passwords with your friends, but Android 12 takes it up a notch, as you can now share the WiFi credentials using Android’s Nearby Share&nbsp;feature, saving you that little bit of hustle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Scrolling Through Your Screenshots</strong>?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Scrolling screenshots are still a bit janky/broken, but it actually works!

It can be done simply by heading over to Settings then selecting Sound and vibration, and at last, the Media option where you&#8217;ll be getting a list of all the media apps and a toggle to select if you want media controls for that app or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s some design overhaul too. The media player is now slightly bigger than the one we saw in Android 11, with bigger artwork and an icon for the device without its name.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Privacy Indicators</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Android 12 is testing new sensor privacy options for camera and microphone, as I previously reported. <a href=\"https://t.co/AtNbu5kyEM\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/AtNbu5kyEM</a></p>&mdash; Mishaal Rahman (@MishaalRahman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1362499338426060808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">February 18, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, there&#8217;s not even a slight hint of privacy indicators in the Android 12. But it seems like they&#8217;ll make their way to upcoming iterations of developer preview, as shown in leaked Android 12 images. But as spotted by XDA&#8217;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman\" class=\"rank-math-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mishaal Rehman</a>, Google will warn you before an app turns on microphone and camera usage, even in the Camera and Recorder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These were some of the features introduced in the latest Android flavor, but there are many others, and many of them being hidden, it will take some time to explore the developer preview. So, for the time being, sit tight and wait for another preview of Android 12&#8217;s developer preview, where we&#8217;ll delve more into the first developer preview of Android 12.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/apple-m1x-forecast-what-to-expect/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Apple M1X Forecast — Why we want more of Apple’s Silicon</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What&#8217;s in Store? &#8211; Developers Edition</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some other behind the hood changes that oriented more towards developers as name suggests, and are meant to make the development seamless for app developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Compatible Media Transcoding</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays, most camera apps can shoot HEVC format videos, but some apps are still incompatible with the new codec. For those apps, Google has introduced a transcoder in Android 12 that transcodes the HEVC file into AVC. It&#8217;s not an instant process; it does take some time to transcode the video depending on your phone&#8217;s hardware. For example, Pixel 4 can transcode a one-minute 1080p video at 30fps in 9 seconds. One of the best things is that the process is quite easy, you need to opt-in for the compatible media transcoding, and the feature will be activated on all the devices that record videos in HEVC format.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>AVIF Image Support</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns are-vertically-aligned-top\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image4-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-144566\" srcset=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image4-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image4-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image4-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image4-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image4-696x392.jpg 696w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image4-1068x601.jpg 1068w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image4.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>AVIF (18.2kB)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image2-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"Android 12\" class=\"wp-image-144567\" srcset=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image2-696x392.jpg 696w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image2-1068x601.jpg 1068w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image2.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>JPEG (20.7kB)</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Google has introduced the support for AV1 Image File Format (AVIF) in Android 12. To explain AVIF in simpler terms, the image quality gets a dramatic improvement compared to a JPEG image of the same size.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Rich Content Insertion</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Who doesn&#8217;t like an app full of rich content (images, videos, and other expressive content), but it&#8217;s quite a headache for developers to insert and move this content in apps. So, to ease things up, Android 12 has introduced a unified API that lets apps accept content from any source, including clipboard, keyboard, or you can even drag and drop.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Haptic-Coupled Audio Effect</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Android 12 brings audio-coupled haptic feedback&nbsp;using your phone&#8217;s vibrator motor&nbsp;to create more immersive audio and gaming experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Immersive Mode API Improvements for Gesture Navigation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Android 12 simplifies the gesture navigation during the immersive mode, and according to Google, it&#8217;s now much easier and more consistent. Well, it&#8217;s just now about one swipe instead of swiping twice. Accidental touches are still being handled as they were, but now exiting full-screen experiences are much simpler.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Project Mainline</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Project Mainline has received a new module with the Android 12 update, the Android Runtime (ART) module&nbsp;, that directly pushes the update to the core runtime and libraries on the devices running Android 12. So with Android 12, runtime performance and correctness, manage memory can be more efficiently, and Kotlin operations can be much faster without a full system update.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Optimizations to Foreground Service</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Google has added a new expedited job in JobScheduler that gets elevated process priority and runs immediately regardless of being the phone in battery saving or doze mode, which leads to less number of apps killed in the background and smoother app performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are some of the developer-focused features that Google has introduced with the Android 12 Developer Preview. Still, there are many other features intended to make the experience seamless, and if you want to know more about them, you can head to Google&#8217;s <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/02/android-12-dp1.html\" class=\"rank-math-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Android Developers Blog</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>When is it Coming Out?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"789\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Android-12-Release-Date-Schedule-Feb-2021.jpg\" alt=\"Android 12\" class=\"wp-image-144568\" srcset=\"https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Android-12-Release-Date-Schedule-Feb-2021.jpg 789w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Android-12-Release-Date-Schedule-Feb-2021-300x68.jpg 300w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Android-12-Release-Date-Schedule-Feb-2021-768x175.jpg 768w, https://www.techquila.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Android-12-Release-Date-Schedule-Feb-2021-696x159.jpg 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 789px) 100vw, 789px\" /><figcaption>Credits: Google</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s just been a day since Google released the first developer preview for the Android 12. There are two more developer preview releases scheduled, ending in April. Then we have four beta releases till August, by which Google will squash most of the bugs. After then only we&#8217;ll get a stable release.

The webcam uses a Sony Exmor R 4K CMOS sensor, delivering a clean image at 30 fps when recording at 4K. Lowering that, you can get a smooth 60 fps presentation at 1080p, recorded in MJPEG or UYVY. If you&#8217;re into investing in streaming products, then the 513 should easily be a nice upgrade over the entry-level webcams you can get from AVerMedia right now.
