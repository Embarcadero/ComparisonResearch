Overview
The goal of the Calculator is to build a generic calculator similar to the standard part of the Windows 10 calculator. This is a prototype. The important part is the research learned during the process and recording the process the second time through. It does not need a huge amount of polish but it should look decent.
The goal of building the Calculator is to explore the strengths and weaknesses of the framework you are building it in. The app should be built once and then built again and the process should be recorded to video.
Transparency
The calculator window should be semi-transparent if it will not take more than 5 hours to add that feature.
Responsive

The bottom section is broken into two sections The left section has the number buttons and the right section has the operator section.
